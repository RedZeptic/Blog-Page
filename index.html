                    <p><b>Day 002:</b> <u><em>August 2st 2022:</em></u><br>
                        Today was quite the busy day, and to explain why will require some filler of my back story. 
                        So in my day to day life I work at a local ecommerce brick and mortor, that also does tech support for the area. 
                        I<em>(22)</em> live at home with my Brother<em>(soon to be 21)</em> and my Girlfriend<em>(20)</em>. 
                        My mother use to not so long ago live with us at our house, which is more of a townhome apartment building, but since recent has been staying in the same town she works in day to day. 
                        Every weekend, typically saturday, I drive down to where she stays and we go shopping for her grocries and spend some time together. 
                        And roughly once every 3 weeks I drive down to pick her up and bring her to our place for the week. 
                        Well that's what I did today, that driving part, so right after work I drove down(1.5hrs) to her and picked her up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My car, which is actually her car but is a longer story and honestly TL;DR, starts having some issues and we need to take a pitstop and let it sit for a brief amount of time. 
                        We head to our predestined location, a fast food joint! 
                        And we go in to grab a snack while we wait, I had already promised my Girlfriend that I would pick her up a lemonaide to bring back, my mom got some fries and a cookie to enjoy. 
                        Needless to say I left work at basically 4pm and arrived back home at 7pm. 
                        I start work everyday at 8:30am and really like to get plently of sleep so I had to quickly make dinner and get myself upstairs onto my computer to continue the <b><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfCode&src=typeahead_click" target="_blank">#100DaysOfCode</a></b> <b><a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/" target="_blank">Challenge!</a></b>
                        so I made this! This webpage is what I am using currently to <em>"blog"</em> about this coding challenge and where it takes me. 
                        So I've spent the past lil over an hour working on this, writing up everything I think I should put in it, and this is the result!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I will continue to work on this webpage after every session to fillout what I did that day, keeping a log of each step and difficult thing I came accross, and show that I can overcome them! 
                        It definitely helps that when I express dificulty with something during this challenge that I will have it logged and know what to focus more of my learning time on practicing. 
                        Thanks for reading!

                    <p><b>Day 001:</b> <u><em>August 1st 2022:</em></u><br>
                        I started on freecodecamp and entered into the <u><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">(New)Responsive Web Design Certification</a></u>. 
                        After completing the course in roughly an hour or longer, I cannot remember as I was "in the zone", I decided I wanted to continue practicing the new information that was fresh in my mind. 
                        I took the now finished page and loaded it onto half of my lefthand monitor, one of my two total monitors, and then put a fresh .html file next to it. 
                        I used the loaded premade page as reference and did my very best to replicate the work onto the new .html file without just completely copying the straight up code line by line. 
                        After I got down past the first list I got stuck with the figure tag and figcaption part of the page, more so I forgot how I implemented those images with added text underneath.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I then got to what for me was the most "forgotten" part of this first project. 
                        <a href="CatPhotoApp.html" target="_blank">The Cat Form</a>, or in general, html forms with attributes, buttons, inputs, so many parts. 
                        I ended up peeking at the original reference page's html code to refresh my memory on what it was suppose to be. 
                        This then was leading me to remember enough parts to piece the rest of the buttons and labels together. 
                        I know looking back at it wonder in what way can I setup the part of this project myself that receives the submit field information, like where does it go? 
                        And how can I use it? 
                        Much to learn and lots to practice. 
                        I am grately looking forward to it!
