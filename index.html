                <p>
                    Today I took a break from my website to focus on watching some reviews on The Odin Project, afterwhich I started up their curriculum and joined their discord.
                    I didn't get super far in their fundementals course as I'm still within the first section or so, and I will definitely do much more tomorrow.
                    They did a great job at getting the basic information I may have needed to know before getting into programming, but I've already commited to persuing this field.
                    I am thinking of possibly branching out from web development at somepoint and getting into either script making, plugins, or even modding video games such as minecraft by using java.
                    But I have yet to hard commit to even attempting that so web dev is where I'm at for the time being.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the reviews of The Odin Project it seemed basically all positive and a great resource to get into this field in a richer way than using freeCodeCamp as of right now.
                    My thoughts on this could change in the future so we'll see how well this post ages in the long run.
                    Excited to get into the rest of the course and I'll catch up with you tomorrow!

                    I spent my time today working on the About Me page, and primarily the Projects page.
                    Which is giving me such a hard time, I'm trying to scale down my project images responsively so when the viewport shrinks the images and containing columns will do the same.
                    This is way harder than I thought and I am definitely in need of more time to work this problem out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I filled my about page with Lorem ipsum for the time being as I didn't want to spend the majority of my time working on that over actual code work.
                    I feel as though I am at the bottom of a mountain looking up the steep slope when it comes to how much I know and what I can do vs how much I need to know to do what I want to do.
                    It's quite intimidating. I think I'll either switch tasks for a bit and go to the odin project for awhile and then come back to my blog page with more education under my belt.
                    Or I'll keep chugging away at the current task at hand being the different pages.
                    I want something presentable and not ugly.
                    And I have a hard time stopping myself from working on a problem until its suitable for the time being.

                    Yesterday I was attempting to get my JS code to pull html code from html files and feed it into a section of the blog html page.
                    For some reason unknown to me I was getting 2 GitHub 404 screens on one page, one ontop of the other and that was so confusing.
                    I don't know anywhere close enough to know what to do in a moment like that, so after having a panic attack I ended up reverting it all into this one html file.
                    Really dissapointing because I really liked the idea of making building blocks for the site to use in many places with a simple class tag added into any of them, feeding the seperate file data in.
                    But alas it bricked my repo and I will have to reattempt that at a later date.
                    Funny thing is, the setup worked perfectly on the live server plugin, so it might just be a GitHub issue.
                    Nothing more to add for today, chat tomorrow!

                <p>
                    Today I spent a huge portion of my time working on this new blog page!
                    I still have lots to do, such as the About, Projects, and Contact pages linked in the navbar still need to be flushed out with their respective content.
                    I'm proud of how far I've gotten on this so far, I've used JavaScript for the first time to allow me to input html files into my index.html <em>(SPOILER The JS code broke GitHub Pages, I'm guessing)</em>.
                    I don't fully understand each part of the JavaScript file code, just enough to know it works thanks to a video tutorial I found on youtube.
                    I think the next few entries into this blog, however many that may be, will be focusing on this blog page and the development with it.
                    Afterwhich I will move on to The Odin Project.
                    Also you can access the old blog page <a target="_blank" href="blog-v1\index.html">here</a> if you were ever curious as to what it looked like before this v2.0 change
                </p>
                <p>
                    Side note, I also finally fixed the portfolio page project. I just swapped the href to the actual link, cause it was being annoying.
                    Also I need to still update Blog v2.0's Navbar to be mobile device friendly, because currently I do not think it is. <em>@media</em> queries should fix it up real quick... heh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also the name change.
                    Likely a strange thing to see on a page for someone reading this, I'm sure.
                    Like I had mentioned before I want to change my name to reflect something I chose, and that name is currently Zehd.
                    So from now on, until I Possibly change my mind in the future, this will be my name.
                    Reflected on my socials as well, once I get around to changing them :)
                    I'm just a person trying to find my own identity that is of my own choosing.
                    Thank you for reading!

                <p>
                    I spent a good 1.5hrs working on a new index.html for this blog page to become. 
                    I only got as far as making the nav bar but I think it's pretty good. 
                    With less current projects to show off I'm going to keep the new index to myself until it's mostly done, and then I am happy to show it off.
                    I may also be thinking of changing my legal name, so if you dig into the html file you will see it, lol
                    Had to look into ways to center list items vertically in the nav bar using display inline, and line-height.
                    Both super useful, and I look forward to building this page out more and more.
                    I honestly could keep working on this page for hours, but I know I need to take it slow and not burn myself out on it.
                    I've gotten 40 days in and at this point I'm feeling great!
                    I'm quickly approaching 50% of the way there, and thats crazy to think about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I got to experience bug fixing today, sort of. 
                    When my portfolio page had the wrong hyperlinks to the 4 projects displayed, I had to obviously change that to reflect the project paths, but also when I did fix them I encountered a quirk.
                    Where I was using <em>\projectfolder-container\project-folder\index.html</em> it was putting the entire path 2 times into the url sneak peak when hovering over the project tiles.
                    when I tried ..\ it put <em>projectfolder-container\projectfolder-container\project-folder\index.html</em>.
                    Leading me to just have <em>.\projectfolder-container\project-folder\index.html</em> which ended up working.
                    There is conflicting info about this online so I just tried stuff out until github pushed my repo commit to the pages site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyhow, I got it working right, and now the portfolio is working properly. 
                    I had also made some small changes to spacing on the socials section but nothing of great importance. 
                    Thats all for today, Bye!

                <p>
                    Today... is a wonderful day! 
                    I completed the <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Portfolio (Final Project)\index.html" target="_blank">Portfolio</a> project and I think it turned out wonderful! 
                    I am excited to say that I've received my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc690c3e68-0764-41c9-892a-42ac218cf3b2/responsive-web-design">certificate</a> from freeCodeCamp's course!! 
                    But anyhow, today I focused on relearning more about flexbox and grid to get my project tiles into place, as they were just not right as of yesterday. 
                    And speaking of yesterday, for some reason the update to this page didn't get pushed to my GitHub? so it seems I am missing 1 green box out of all the others in a row. 
                    Really dissapointing if this is the case, but at least I have this blog and daily twitter posts showing my completion and consistancy! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I cannot wait to start up on the odin project, for better or for worse I think the change of pace and style will be fun and difficult. 
                    One step at a time eh? 
                    Looking forward to it, and overhauling this website! 
                    Chat tomorrow :)

                <p>
                    After getting back from a long day on the road, going all over the place. 
                    I got home around 8:30pm and started working on my <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Portfolio (Final Project)\Sep7Post\index.html">portfolio</a> project. 
                    During which i've hit a wall of difficulty where I just do not know how to do the layout of the project section. 
                    It is clear to me I need to get some more tutorials under my belt before I can fully tackle this problem the way I want to solve it. 
                    And after a long day like today, I am very exhausted, so I'm calling it a night. Chat tomorrow!

                <p>
                    I got started working on the <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Portfolio (Final Project)\Sep6Post\index.html" target="_blank">Portfolio</a> page and this is how it turned out so far, in about 2hrs. 
                    I'm honestly having such a hard time getting the essentials of placing objects around the screen and aligning them properly. 
                    I think there is plenty more I need to practice to get the hang of building sites from scratch. 
                    The navbar itself is always time consuming and difficult due to which display method should I be using? 
                    When is the right time and right way to use justify-content? 
                    How do I get an object to be ceneterd vertically in its parent element? 
                    And so on. 
                    I've for the most part figured out how to do these things, but remembering them and having the ah-ha moment I get when, for instance, I color text, backgrounds etc. 
                    The ease that comes with those. I want that with moving stuff around. Where it all just clicks in my head.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'll be really busy tomorrow, won't be able to code in the morning so I'm hoping I can get home at a decent time and still be able to get some time in... 
                    But alas my time for today is over and I have stuff I need to do to get ready for tomorrow! 
                    I shall update you then!

                <p>
                    I done did the thing! 
                    I completed the <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Penguin\index.html">Penguin</a> project thus marking my last non-mandatory step to getting freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification! 
                    In the next project I will be building a portfolio page that has a hero section and showcases the projects I've worked on up till this point. 
                    Today was also a day I noticed my literacy with the step prompts being so much better than a few weeks ago. 
                    I can take the vague and oddly worded steps and just "guess" and it turning out correct. 
                    When thrown things I've not used or done yet before, in a prompt, I was able to assume their use of terminology and put in the correct code first try. 
                    And that really suprised me, and took me back to the first few days/weeks where it was almost a stuggle dealing with the steps. 
                    And I've mentioned it many times in previous posts so I wont go into it here :)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a feeling that this next project will take me a few days to crack out. 
                    I work tomorrow(tuesday) which is no problem and will give me plenty of time to work out the main parts of it, but I will be out all day on wednesday going to UCSF for a Doc Appoint. w/ my Girlfriend. 
                    So little more is needed to be said, I will be quite busy. 
                    I'm worried I wont be able to get my day in on that day but I'm hopeful that I wont be too burned out by the end of the day that I could still squeeze out something. 
                    Even just a few lines of code would be good enough for me. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a side note, I really think once this portfolio project is done with, I will spend some time reworking this webpage. 
                    Possibly a full overhaul of it, organize is better, make proper stuff I have dreamed up. 
                    Things I know I can do, as this site was me trying to build something I had yet to have practice making. 
                    So with my fresher knowledge I think this page could look a great deal better than it does now. 
                    No idea how far I can take it, but I'm ecstatic to see where I can get with it.
                    Have a wonderful day, I'll catch you in tomorrows post :)

                    I got to about step 70 on today project where I am building a frozen winter scene with a penguin. 
                    There are still like 40 or so more steps to go but I could only get so far within my time frame today. 
                    Here is my progress status as of right now on the <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Penguin\Sep4Post\index.html">Penguin</a> project.
                    I think it's turning out to be really cute and I'm exited to get to the end where I will make it wave at the user, which is even cuter. 
                    This is the second to last project for the responsive-web-design cert from freeCodeCamp meaning I am SO close to being done. 
                    The last project, being the last mandatory one, is building a portfolio site, not sure what that entails but I'm stoked to work on it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway I hope everyone has a wonderful holiday weekend, I'm going to spend some time with my family and maybe play a board game or two. 
                    Take care!

                    After being out driving for awhile today, and also going to see a movie. 
                    I returned home really exhausted. 
                    But I managed to get lucky and have a "quicker" project waiting for me. 
                    I completed the 29 step <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Ferris Wheel\index.html">Ferris Wheel</a> project. 
                    It introduced animation principles, such as the animation... properties, and @keyframes at-selector. 
                    I can see how these are super powerful and it looks like the next project will be using them again to make a full CSS penguin wave at the user. 
                    So I have that to look forward to. 
                </p>

                    Also I would like to mention I've made it over 1/3rd the way to 100 Days! 
                    How exciting!!

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 033:</b> <u><em>September 2nd 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    Today I got home quite early as it was a really slow day at work. 
                    I was then able to tackle my mandatory coding project from freeCodeCamp at 3:15pm. 
                    I worked on it from then all the way until 8:30pm and I completed the project! 
                    I am actually really proud of this page and I think it turned out fantastic! 
                    The project was aimed at creating a product page, and with the reference page as my target to mimick I decided that making a page based on bananas as the focal point was a great idea. 
                    definitely not due to me finding a banana logo svg on a free svg repo site... totally not. 
                    With this inspiration I created a gross version of the page, witch was me figuring out how big things were and where they were on a white background. 
                    By gross I mean a bunch of colored boxes around the elements. 
                    But after I got the stuffs in the sorta right spots I prettied it up a bit and fixed up the leftover positioning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This lead me to finishing it up as I was consumed by wanting this page done. 
                    I'll be traveling tomorrow and I hope I will have some time to work on the next project, which is more tutorial based rather than a serious project like todays.
                    I will say, I very much enjoyed the stuggle to get the page the way I wanted, and my time dedication shows it! 
                    I've been holding off on showing you the project just yet but here it is... The <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Product Landing Page (Mandatory Project)\index.html">Banana</a> product page!
                    I used some free to use b-roll from a banana farm, likely from costa rica, but I didn't dive that deep into this. 
                    I just needed something to match the video from the <a target="_blank" href="https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks/#how-it-works">reference</a> page. 
                    I would have never guessed I would make this type of a page but I really had fun. 
                    Oh and I'm WELL aware that my code is... very close to what spaghetti looks like. 
                    Always more to learn!

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 032:</b> <u><em>September 1st 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    I completed the <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Magazine\index.html">Magazine</a> project today, and it turned out quite nice. 
                    There was so much Grid stucture and columns/rows that I'm feeling a bit more confident in their usage but still overall the info sticking in my head is probably like 20%. 
                    But it was a good introduction, and I have been wondering how columns are created in the first place for quite some time. 
                    Always wondering this when looking at different websites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now the next project is the 4th mandatory project, once completed marking my 80% completion of freeCodeCamp's course! 
                    Which is really exciting, as I've been talking about going on to other courses within the last 30+ days and I simply cannot wait to try other ones out! 
                    Also going over the same things, in a different order with varying complexities, really excites me. 
                    As it's the best way to really retain the information, repetition, repetition, and more repetition. 
                    But not in any boring way, it must be different in the ways that count. 
                    I cannot imagine going back over and redoing these last 32 days after completing them. 
                    That is what I mean, the sheer repetition that isn't new and refreshing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have just noticed that on every post before today I had marked each date as a __th no matter the number... talk about copy and paste to speed up this part.
                    I literally started it off with 1th and 2th... lmao. 
                    I've corrected this now, but it took me way to long to realize!
                    Have a wonderful evening and I'll catch up tomorrow!

                <p>
                    I cracked out just about 50% of the next project today, that being the <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Magazine\Aug31Post\index.html">Magezine</a> project. 
                    The CSS grid layout and organizing the elements is definitely confusing and I'm not sure if I will learn how to use it on my own projects for the future from this project, but it has so far been a good introductary situation. 
                    In a way its like flex box in that I don't know how to use that to the fullest capabilities but I have at least used it a few times over these 31 days. 
                    Oh yeah thats right, I've done this for over a month! 
                    It's feeling more and more natural everyday I continue and I'm really enjoying that. 
                    Having it integrate with my daily life is quite the difficult change at first but now this far it, its seeming easier and easier by the day. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course doing these lesson projects earlier in the day is helping, and I've noticed that I can't really do them effectively anywhere close to 7pm or later. 
                    At that point I'm just mentally drained and my cognition stops me from intaking the new information as easily.
                    Can't wait to finish this project and try my hand at making a few more projects in the future with css grids.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've had an amazing thought of a program I would love to create at somepoint in the future, I dont want to spoil it, or make any promises but it will be based around shopping and cost effective spending. 
                    Thats all I'll say, have a good day!

                    Today I finished up the <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\City Skyline\index.html">City Skyline</a> project! 
                    I really enjoyed the end, adding in the background/sun and using a @media query to change the scene based on the width of the window. 
                    I specifically liked the part where the windows of the building were still the same color as the day time version but the building itself was dark, it gave such a night life energy to it that I just had to keep it in. 
                    So I made another @media query for a smaller screen to fit in what the tutorial wanted the outcome to be. 
                    Overall this project really put into practice nesting a lot of devs and styling them(in a basic way) to make fairly simplistic buildings, but was still rather enjoyable.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today was also another day I got to working on my coding early, and man is it night and day. 
                    Just like yesterday I found myself with enough energy and was able to enjoy working on this project. 
                    I've also started to go into work 30min later than I was, use to be 8:30 but that was my choice to go in early. 
                    So now  I think I'll go in at 9am (regular time in general) and leave at my normal leaving time, gives me some extra time in my mornings to do other things, or just be slower honestly. 
                    I don't enjoy feeling rushed in the morning, and getting enough sleep is important.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next upcoming project seems to be a newspaper/magezine style article with a bunch of different sections. 
                    And honestly it looks like fun, I'm looking forward to it! 
                    Talk with you in tomorrows post!

                <p>
                    I got quite a bit farther in the <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\City Skyline\Aug29Post\index.html">City Skyline</a> project today, getting quite a bit of styling done!  
                    Getting home early and working on it earlier allowed me to have a move energized mind ready to work on this, so I'm feeling good about that. 
                    Nothing really new being learned today other than repeating-linear-gradiant() and using directions & percetnages to map the color gradients the way I want them to be. 
                    I'm excited to finish this one, as I've been enjoying the asthetic of it(without the * borders). 
                    I don't have any more time to write this blog post, so I will catch up with you tomorrow!

                <p>
                    I continued on with the <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\City Skyline\Aug28Post\index.html">City Skyline</a> project today and got like a third or so through it. 
                    I noticed I messed up the name of the file within the file stucture so I fixed it, added the letter to the end of style. 
                    What I am learning about primarily seems to be variables and using flex box to spread div's around on screen. 
                    One section of today got me really stuck and the prompt did no helping in me solve the issue, I needed to set the background of a building segment to a linear-gradient and using two variables made prior to color the gradient. 
                    The way they word it made it quite confusing for me, but after looking online I found someone else having this same issue and the answer to that user wasn't very clear but It had me guess the correct input for the problem. 
                    I did not like that moment, but the day moves on. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this project I'm making a lot of divs to build up the background and foreground of the city, using :root variables to color the background buildings, first time learning about :root. 
                    I'm being shown a lot of condensing code to make it cleaner to look at, and adding notes to add to that accessibility aspect. 
                    After being this far into freeCodeCamp's projects, I'm strongly noticing that this way of learning is useful to some extent but I don't think its right for me. 
                    It's really repetitively boring and I find myself wanting to do other things. 
                    Even if building webpages and learning how to do so has its fun aspects, this particular way is not what I think I need. 
                    I'm going to do my best to get through it, and as quickly as possible move on to the next thing, see if that one is better.

                    I ended up at the end of my day after being busy for the majority of it, with no energy to push past step 7 on the next project. 
                    I am beyond exhausted and unmotivated at this very moment, but I tried my best. 
                    I think im getting a tad burnt and will take today as a warning to chill out, come back tomorrow and get some real good time in. 
                    This challenge is important to me, and mine to mold and to make it the way I need. 
                    Some R&R seems needed for today. 
                    I don't view this as a failed day but a great lesson in how I should pace myself and prioritize my learning earlier in the day, like I've been saying for days now! 
                    Putting it into practice is harder than imagined but I will push on.

                <p>
                    I accomplished the difficult task of fixing my code! 
                    Now with that and a heavy doesage of salt I can say that this mandatory project was hard! 
                    But I needed it to be, if I made the page the easiest way that simply "met" the critera, that would just feel lack luster. 
                    In my eyes, a great way to practice is to try and replicate, so I did, definitely not as well made as the reference but I'm proud of my newbie capabilities that got me this far! 
                    So here is my replicated <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Documentation (Mandatory Project)\index.html">Documentation Page</a>! 
                    This marks 60% of the course to certification done and I am one step closer to moving on to my next challenge the odin project. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest difficulties I encountered today was getting my media query to work, and well, do what the reference page does, granted not exactly the same but I'm not trying to be exact. 
                    Having the same functionality is what matters to me and I got there in the end. 
                    I needed to watch some short videos and look at some documentation of media queries to figure out why mine wasnt working, and the simplist things hold back the code from working properly. 
                    Thankfully after taking a lot of time ironing out the changes in the code that I needed to make, the page now conforms comfortably with the window size. 
                    That by it self was quite the ordeal, due to overlapping css settings that I had to either rewrite with a different value to null it, or change the value to make it do what was needed. 
                    I enjoyed this project a lot. 
                    Way more "time flies" moments when im not following a simple do this do that tutorial.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thats it for today, I'll see you lot in tomorrows project, seems I'm going to build a city skyline like that one movie companies logo or something lol. 
                    Take care!

                    I got my tattoo today, had very little time I could spend working on my <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Documentation (Mandatory Project)\Aug25Post\index.html">Documentation Page</a>, but I ironed out some of the issues with it, but I still have more work to do tomorrow to get it to pass the freeCodeCamp tests.
                    I made it definitely look better, much closer to the reference page. 
                    My biggest challenges with this page so far have be putting aspects of the page into different sections, the nav bar and main section of the page being side by side being the hardest. 
                    Then needing to make the page jump anchor tags not be all wonky with weird placement but I, after looking over the reference css code, notice I had some un needed padding that was causing that to happen. 
                    Seems I add things to weird spots when I don't need to, and not put them in the spots they are more logically needed. 
                    I'll get the hang of it soon!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm really tired, and need to wash my tattoo site, and head to bed so I'll catch back up with this tomorrow!

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 024:</b> <u><em>August 24th 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    Today I started and got almost all the way done on the <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Documentation (Mandatory Project)\Aug24Post\index.html">Documentation Page Project</a>. 
                    At the beggining it was a lot of setting up the structure of the page to match the visual layout of the reference page they provide at the top of the challenge. 
                    I intentionally wanted the page to be as identical as possible due to the fact that my last mandatory project wasn't and it was way more work than I wanted to make my own themed one. 
                    Not that I don't need the practice making my own, but sourcing the material is just not what I need to spend my time doing when my time is so limited each day. 
                    Another aspect of my version of the page is that in its current state it has colors showing me the size and layout of the navbar sections. 
                    I'm currently trying to figure out how to get those border-top's to reach all the way to the left side of the screen where there are "list-style-type: none" / "list-style: none" bullet points. 
                    I don't know how to make them go away, I think it might be something with "overflow: hidden;" but I ran out of time right before I could solve that, so I'm forced to leave it to tomorrow, or the next day depending on how my tattoo session goes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Relating to the documentation page, I did take some peaks at how the page was setup for its nav bar, and I had guessed prior to looking "is it a unordered list and list items?" which was the correct answer once I saw the multitude of close tabbed list elements within the inspect element feature on chrome. 
                    I had put a "h1" for the main title of the page, but when I saw the reference pages banner title being a header I swapped over to that. 
                    The consistancy of using headers accross the entire page for this use makes a lot of sense, so I don't know why I would want to use a h1 over a header, being almost the same element. 
                    When I get the time, I will of course remove the colors from the page, recolor the text to a dark gray, change the navbar links to not have their decorations and also make their hover, and visited, event not change any colors. 
                    I need to put a lightly blue colored box with rounded edges, which would be border-radius if im not mistaken, to put the "< code >< /code >" into. 
                    Spacing it out appropriately with padding I presume. 
                    Back to the navbar, it is in great need of being fixed to the webpages view but that problem is quite complex at this moment so I have yet to attack it head on to get the navbar menu to travel with the viewer up and down the page without the main sections content being put underneath the navbar, hiding crucial information needing to be viewed. 
                    At least if I want the page to be as close to the reference as possible. 
                    Again, I am trying to do that without looking at the reference code, there would be no point in any of this if I spoiled my problem solving skills by copying it line for line. 
                    I mean, I want this as a perfession and I don't think I would be doing myself any favors by taking the easy way out. 
                    Not really the easy way either, as in the end I cannot solve my problems I come accross thus leading to everything being the hard way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also noticed when loading up my blog-page on mobile that some stuff is broken... I'll fix that when I can! lol. 
                    That's all I got for today, take care and I'll update this tomorrow with more information as to where I'm at!

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 023:</b> <u><em>August 23rd 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    I got today kicked off by completing the <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Piano\index.html">Piano page</a> and I really enjoyed some parts of this one! 
                    With a lot of these concepts still being super vague to me as how I would come up with them to know when to use them on my own, I found the @media part really cool. 
                    Without any guidance on how it really works(from freeCodeCamp) after looking up the documentation to it, I was, am still amazed by the simplicity and "coolness" of it. 
                    Using it to make logical statements for styling made me giggle with sheer "awwhhh" and gitty excitement. 
                    I'm not sure why learning that you can make a @media tag and make it it's own whole styling sheet blew me away but it did. 
                    Gaining actual enjoyment from learning that, which is a first in awhile. 
                    These tutorials have been a lot of do this do that, and bam it's done with no real... substance to show you the might of the cool tools!
                    I also recolored the piano page, I simply disliked the green colored piano and white background. 
                    So I made it closer to my own. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now on the horizon for the next few days(if it takes that long) is the next mandatory project for the freeCodeCamp certification. 
                    I'll be building a documentation page, and just from the sound of it I think it might be a doozy. 
                    Granted I could be wrong but so far these mandatory projects have been the most fun, and the most effort. 
                    I've have the occasional non mandatory project that almost puts me to sleep because its repetitive and awfully boring, the painting ones were this for me. 
                    I've noticed since yesterday when I was working on this webpage and stylesheet, making it better organized and nicer to look at, that I really enjoy working on projects that are not tutorials. 
                    Like I feel genuine pleasure and satisfaction from playing around and trying new things to get something to work. 
                    Not always succeeding but I am still very new to this. And after the slump I was/am in over the past few days, I feel if I chase this feeling it will be a great choice for me. 
                    Now this kind of sounds like I want to not follow tutorials and what not, but thats not the case. 
                    I still need to learn and want to accomplish these learn by doing projects. 
                    And I cannot think of a better way to get use to coding often and exposing myself to new concepts. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So far today was a good day(minus the work section of it - lol). 
                    I'm trying to keep a good mindset that my Mom has taught me, that this[my job] is allowing me to get to where I want to be, and do what I want to do. 
                    It helps a bit to get through the large portion of my day, and I really and shifting my mentality of sitting down to code into "man I really wanna get home and code". 
                    Learning new things is never easy, and coding falls right into that basket. 
                    I put so much stress and pressure onto myself that it ends up looming over me, when I should just try and enjoy it. 
                    What rush am I in really, to make myself this stressed out.

                <p>
                    I completed the <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Picasso Painting\index.html">Picasso Page</a>, and honestly a lot of this project was "in one year out the other". 
                    Simply due to the fact that I had a busy past few days and this was, to me, not a super interesting project. 
                    Like the outcome is pretty ugly, but the teachings are being repitiously imprinted into me so that's probably the best part I suppose. 
                    I feel familiar with most aspects of the code but still a little distant on how I could actively plan to use these techniques myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I spent earlier in the day(while at work) listening to some coding podcasts talking about how to better direct your Linkedin profile and how to network with the devoloper community. 
                    Gaining some great tips for making connections, that I'm sure I'll use when I'm closer to competent. 
                    On another note, I have been a certain type of typist when it comes to how I input with my keyboard, being a mixture between a index tapper and a full hand typer. 
                    I intend on practicing my typing to get better at being a more skilled typer, allowing me to be able to type without making as many mistakes(hopefully!). 
                </p>
                <p><em>Appended:</em> I updated the look of this page, and I think its nicer now :)</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Personal Section:</b> Today was really tough getting up and going into work. 
                    I constantly felt like not showing up there ever again, parts of the atmosphere there makes me super uncomfortable and the tasks themselves are not something I find any amount of pride in. 
                    I'm a sensitive person and when I feel any specific emotion it's usually very powerful. 
                    Dredding going to work, and do something I don't like, be around people who are negative and soul sucking, really hits me hard on my mental health. 
                    At this same time I'm searching and racking my head trying to figure a way out of this and a way into something I really am interested in and passionate about. 
                    But also being doubtful of myself in whatever options I lay out for myself. 
                    I think I may want to go into entrepreneurship or down a path similar to that, but again, I feel some strong imposter vibes coming my way. 
                    I'm feeling stuck, trapped, and kept in this routine by bills, and looming responsibilities. 
                    I know I will find some way, but during this finding part of that it is really bleak and depressing. 
                    A thing I think about a lot is that I don't have much of if any quality down time, I use to get that from playing video games. 
                    But now I feel all I do is watch youtube, stress about the next workday ahead of me and make myself work on my coding education(which I want to do, but having the energy is a real B sometimes).
                    <b>TL;DR:</b> Life recurringly has felt gaping and baseless, devoid of true quality and sense of comfort. I'm doing my best to work through it, and I want to make it better for myself. 
                    Even with being unsure as to how to do that, I want to feel fulfilled and will try my best to get there.

                    Today I got a bit more progress done on the <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Picasso Painting\Aug21Post\index.html">Piccaso Painting</a> page. 
                    Almost finishing it, but I ran out of time. 
                    It's exposing me to more CSS techniques that are more on the side of the way to do things rather than how to do them, if that makes sense. 
                    Also exposing me to symbols and different ways of moving colored objects around the screen. 
                    I'm still rather tired from yesterday so this is enough for me, on to tomorrow.

                <p>
                    I just got back from being out all day on a family trip, I didn't have much time to code but I got some time in early this morning before leaving the house. 
                    I got a little bit into the next project and you can see <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Picasso Painting\Aug20Post\index.html">that here</a>. 
                    Now I am so exhausted I have no more energy to put into this blog post, I drove so much, was out all day. 
                    I feel I could collapse at any moment, so gnite! and I'll check back in tomorrow for day 21!

                <p>
                    Today I completed the <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Balance Sheet\index.html">Balance Sheet</a>. 
                    I have so little energy today to mentally get through this, taking short pauses every 10 steps or so. 
                    I really have been feeling burnt on this whole process up to today. 
                    Things in my day to day life have been affecting my mood and this combined with me running out of steam early today. 
                    I'll say this, I learned of some new ways to address classes, moreover why I would want to use this method. 
                    the element[class=""] is used to pick out a specific element that only contains that class and no other, while the element.classname chooses every element that has that class included, even if it has others too. 
                    Beyond that I used more attributes that move text around, and loads of other things that feel fuzzy in my head. 
                    So much information and so little energy to want to dive into understanding them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tomorrow Day 20, I am going on a family trip, it's a one day trip but I am going to be gone for quite awhile at a waterpark. 
                    I am extremely unsure of how I will get coding done tomorrow but at the end of the day I will still try. 
                    If push comes to shove, I may have to stop this challenge but I also might be able to do something less intense once I'm back home. 
                    We'll see.

                <p>
                    I started working on a <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Balance Sheet\Aug18Post\index.html" target="_blank">Balance Sheet</a> (not done, 50% there) page today using html tables and setting it up for screen reader help. 
                    Here are some of the elements I used today, ones I'm still new to using:
                </p>
                <p>HTML</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_table.asp" target="_blank">< table ></a>, the tag responsible for building out a table in html. Similar to any container tag, but only for tables.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_caption.asp#:~:text=Definition%20and%20Usage,align%20and%20place%20the%20caption." target="_blank">< caption ></a>, this tag is required to be the first in the table tag, and defines a text caption for the table.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_thead.asp" target="_blank">< thead ></a> (table head), this tag is similar to the header tag, but for the table container tag.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_tbody.asp" target="_blank">< tbody ></a> (table body), this tag is in the same position as the header but replicating the body container for the table.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_tr.asp" target="_blank">< tr ></a> (table row), this defines a row in an HTML table.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_th.asp" target="_blank">< th ></a> (table header), this tag defines a header cell in an HTML table.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_td.asp#:~:text=The%20tag%20defines%20a,with%20the%20element)" target="_blank">< td ></a> (table data), this defines a header cell in an HTML table, essentially to a label for the column.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>CSS</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>span[class~="sr-only"], using this in place of .sr-only and I'm not really sure why this way would be better.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_clip.asp" target="_blank">clip:</a> Attribute.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/css3_pr_clip-path.asp" target="_blank">clip-path:</a> Attribute.</li>
                    <li>-webkit-clip-path: Attribute, which confuses me currently.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inset" target="_blank">inset(50%)</a> value.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_overflow.asp" target="_blank">overflow:</a> Attribute.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space" target="_blank">white-space:</a> Attribute.</li>
                    <li>nowrap; value. relating to the white-space above.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I have plenty of work to do to finish this page up, and I'm getting tired. 
                    Doing this every day is tough! 
                    But the show must go on. 
                    I have not much left to mention or things I want to talk about, but I'm starting to feel like all of this information is a lot and its difficult to absorb. 
                    I never expected to be able to retain everything, and I have retained quite a good amount, but man so much information and following directions for so long makes my energy tumble. 
                    Till tomorrow!

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 017:</b> <u><em>August 17th 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    Just like I said yesterday, I completed the project! the fixes were simple and the misstakes we of my own doing. 
                    I made the project almost perfect the first time (yesterday) but my image id was <b>img</b> when it should have been <b>image</b>. 
                    And a few other issues but you can see my final version of the <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Tribute Page (Mandatory Project)\index.html" target="_blank">Tribute Page here</a>. 
                    Took awhile doing the research part of it, and probably not enough time to make sure the info is perfect but I'm working with what I got! 
                    The topic of choice is an activist I follow and enjoy watching their content. 
                    I also follow the same principles that they layout in their videos.
                <p>
                    But beyond that, I've been listening to a lot of podcasts relating to web developers and boot camps(I cannot attend a boot camp due to life stuff) and It makes me really want to network out and make some friends. 
                    But that is surprise, surprise, hard. 
                    I'm open to connections, talking with fresh newbie devs like myself, all the way up to devs that know their shit. 
                    Over the next couple weeks I'm going to be in a more difficult posting with coding everyday due to a new tattoo im getting on Day 25, so there is a good chance my progress on that day will be limited. 
                    But also from that my speed at which I type will be (I think) inhibited a little bit, due to the placement of the t once I have that tattoo, even networking will be hard, and I feel at this current stage being only 17 days in my ability to find someone to talk to who would want to talk with me will be hard. 
                    I'm not even sure what we'd talk about really... I mean obviously code and stuff but, the how is my current quandary. attoo. 
                    My main point with this is,
                    Any how, I'm proud of this step, I've passed the 2nd mandatory project for the certificate, meaning im <a href="images\fCC-40percent.PNG" target="_blank">40% there!</a> 
                    Once finished I'll move on the The Odin Project, at the recommendation of Michael White Dev on YT, he's pretty cool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    See you tomorrow!

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 016:</b> <u><em>August 16th 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    Today was all about tackling the challenge to make a <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Tribute Page (Mandatory Project)\Aug16Post\index.html" target="_blank">tribute page</a>, so far I wasn't able to get it to pass freeCodeCamp's test but IMO its looking great! 
                    Now after running the code through freeCodeCamp's tester I now know what I need to work on to get it to fit their standards. 
                    I did deviate away from the simplicity of what they wanted and I'm sure some of the choices I made took the code out of the passing score. 
                    There were also a few things that weren't told to me, like putting some img caption in its own div, I made it work without doing that. 
                    But alas I will be required to do some rework and get it meeting the given standards. 
                    The project has been quite fun so far, and honestly the time flew by, I could just keep working on it longer but I'm at my time limit end! 
                    There is not much I learned today, as it's been practice and solving small problems. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The topic for my tribute page is on a fellow vegan who does loads of activism and content online, I look up to him and his story is quite the tale. 
                    This project made me choose something to make the page about, and I could have totally made it, something I'm able to make up for the sake of doing. 
                    But that didn't seem right to me, so I based it on something real, and someone who I don't personally know, and is not super well documented(unlike historical figures who have passed away).
                    That's all I have to share, thank you for reading. 
                    Tomorrow this page should be complete and we can get a good look at them side by side!

                <p>
                    Today after throwing on some calm ambience from a specific video game from 2011, I put my nose to the grindstone and smashed out the project I was having issues with yesterday. 
                    I just needed to suck up the fact that it is how it is, and push on! 
                    So here is the <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Building a Quiz\index.html" target="_blank">completed version</a> of what I worked on. 
                    I completed like 40 some odd steps today, and learned about some new things that I hadn't gone over before thus far in the course. 
                    I have them sorted into two lists, one from HTML and one from CSS.     
                </p>
                <p>HTML</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_address.asp" target="_blank">< address ></a> tag, being a tag to put your site / resorce address info in a footer as an example.</li>
                    <li>The <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_accesskey.asp#:~:text=The%20accesskey%20attribute%20specifies%20a,to%20activate%2Ffocus%20an%20element.&text=However%2C%20in%20most%20browsers%20the,access%20key%20will%20be%20activated" target="_blank">accesskey=""</a> feature. allowing easy access to sections of the page based on keystrokes.</li>
                    <li>refreshing me on the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_for.asp" target="_blank">for=""</a> attribute, marking a linkage between a label and an input.</li>
                    <li>the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby" target="_blank">aria-labelledby=""</a> attribute which was never explained. Simply its to reference a interactive element with a identifying name for the user.</li>
                    <li>the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-role-attribute/#:~:text=The%20role%20attribute%20describes%20the,as%20screen%20readers%20or%20magnifiers.&text=Screen%20Readers%20will%20read%20this,%E2%80%9D%20instead%20of%20%E2%80%9Clink%E2%80%9D." target="_blank">role=""</a> attribute being a way to make a screen reader view a element as a specific other element/region.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>CSS</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio" target="_blank">aspect-ratio:__</a> which controls the aspect ratio of the given element it is affecting.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp" target="_blank">@media</a> rule which was not really explained well, and I will probably learn more about later.</li>
                    <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before" target="_blank">::before</a> pseudo-element selecting the first child of the given element. <em>ex. p::before.</em></li>
                    <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button" target="_blank">< button ></a> element being... well a button.</li>
                    <li>And lastly just getting refreshed on using flexbox, like the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content" target="_blank">justify-content</a> property, which helps the browser distribute the space between objects(content) along the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Main_Axis" target="_blank">main-axis</a> of a flex container.</li>
                    <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-behavior" target="_blank">scroll-behavior</a> property which sets the type of scrolling animation(through APIs) for navigating the regions with accesskey binds or inpage hyperlinks.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    That's just about it! 
                    Tomorrow marks a big day, or days. 
                    As it is when I start the next mandatory project for the certification. 
                    I'm excited and anxious about the difficulty of it, but never the less I am feeling ready to tackle it, with out without the knowledge that freeCodeCamp has or hasn't given me! 
                    Wish me the best!

                <p>
                    Two weeks in and I'm finally getting pissed off(a little exagerated) at freeCodeCamp's step prompts occasionally leaving out parts it wants you to put. 
                    Now I understand the whole bit of "research to figure out whats wrong" but they give a hint... and yes sure that's helpful, but you could just show me how to do that in the first place, and I'd have a reference to come back to in the future, rather than just not giving me a reason behind why something fails to their expectations. 
                    Overall their instructions are lackluster, and only sometimes when they word their "hey do this" in a specific way that doesn't give you the answer but has you figure out how to do it, then it's great, and it feels like I figured it out myself. 
                    Essentially it's holding your hand through the projects, expecting you to know the next step without showing you how to take it, and then telling you be nudging you and gesturing to themselves, showing you in very basic ways what you need/are forgetting(how can I forget if I never knew it in the first place?).
                    Also with the way they say how to do things, or actually what order to do them in. 
                    It will tell you to put this tag in, and nest this one, and add this other one. 
                    And when you do that, it errors! 
                    Tells you a not so helpful hint, and then you just look at the code, move something around and then its like yeah thats good! 
                    The great side of freeCodeCamp so far has been the project based learning, and I've learned quite a bit more than I knew before. 
                    Their execution is somewhat not fitting my style of learning but I will push on to complete all of the projects to get the certification. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today I worked on the <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Building a Quiz\Aug14Post\index.html" target="_blank">Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz project</a>. 
                    It was a difficult one for some of the mentioned issues with the teaching method stated in the above paragraph, but overall the actual code itself makes sense. 
                    Connecting labels and inputs together, adding screen reader only classes with their respective attributes that make knowing what something on the screen is without people who can see it... well seeing it. 
                    The method of a form being "Post" which I had to look up to actually know what it does, and wasnt told to add it... so the hint was the only way for me to know I needed it. 
                    I did however really like the nav bar, there are some sizing issues when scaling the page but the project isn't dont yet anyway. 
                    The style of it was really nice and I like the layout, I'm inspired for this webpage to look as nice. 
                    This was also my first exposure to using aspect-ratio:__ and I'm happy to know of it now, as well as using the max() and min() size functions in CSS. 
                    Nothing more to add to this post, so I'll finish this project up on Day 15!

                <p>
                    I finished working on the <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Typography Nutrition Label\index.html" target="_blank">Nutrition Label</a> today, after a long day of driving and being far from home. 
                    I swear I am so the kind of person that I could stay home and never leave and probably be fine. 
                    Energy wise, I'm tapped. 
                    I pushed through that though, and smashed out this project, really just getting the ideas of dividers and multiple classes affecting specific tags. 
                    I still think that's super cool and quite powerful! 
                    I still feel quite disorganized when working on these projects. 
                    More over, I feel once I am not following a guide I will find it difficult to remember everything I've done on them, and maybe fall into some bad organization? 
                    Thankfully I have the projects saved here as a piece of this blog and repository, and I can always look back at the source code to refresh myself on any specific thing I've done before. 
                    Being almost 2 weeks in its getting quite complicated. 
                    But I may only be feeling this way due to every time I start coding it's later in the day and my ability to think and comprehend becomes slower. 
                    I wish I could do this earlier in the day every day but that doesnt seem like a possibility, maybe tomorrow? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can't wait to revamp this blog site with more details and style in a few weeks(best guess). 
                    Making this look super pretty-ish is the goal and it will be so nice compared to the current gray style.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a complete left turn of this conversation, I've been wanting to get a tattoo for awhile now. 
                    And while out today I went and scheduled to get one of my own design in a few weeks. 
                    It's going to be put on my right forearm, and is an original design spelling out VEGAN, repping my ethical beliefs on my arm, solid black ink. 
                    I'm excited and just wanted to share. 
                    This will be my first tattoo and I can't wait to get it. 
                    Maybe once is on me I'll show it off, as the design(imo) looks very clean and nice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tomorrow marks 2 weeks, almost time for celebration! that leaves me with 86 more days! And maybe more!? 
                    Honestly I don't know but I want a career in this field so, likely ain't stopping anytime soon.

                <p>
                    I worked on the next project from freeCodeCamp, you can see my progress <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Typography Nutrition Label\Aug12Post\index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. I don't have too much to say on it, besides the amazing fact that you can target specific classes and apply multiple classes to different elements! 
                    Which is super intuitive, for example a div class="thing1 thing2" and with both .thing1 {edited} and .thing2 {edited} both css attributes can be applied in one line of class="". 
                    I love this part so much, and I can see how complex it can get from here. 
                    I havn't finished the project yet, as I got to step 47, but its good for showing me how things can be nested together and how different attributes work, making things bold, float, and use the overflow properties, which still are confusing but I'll get it soon enough. 
                    Now there is not much more I really want to say, I'm going to be quite busy with real life things on day 13, but I will still get my hour of code in to keep this challenge rolling!

                <p>
                    Today was working with more CSS concepts and properties. 
                    A gripe I have with freeCodeCamp at this moment is their way of explaining things they want you to accomplish, such as "make this thing happen and have it have an [ID] of _____" then when I go and do that, and check my code it throws up a "nope, you were suppose to have a [Class=____]" and like... cmon. 
                    but other than that I was working on <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Flex Box Photo Gallery\index.html" target="_blank">this project</a> which is a cat photo gallery made with the teachings of flex box. 
                    Now learning <em>some</em> flex box has actually filled in the part of my knowledge gap that I've had itching at the back of my mind wondering "well how do these things even stay in colums and be structured!". 
                    With this exposure I feel like I am the audiencemeber at a magicians show who knows how the trick is performed and all the secrets behind the showmanship. 
                    Even if I don't fully yet 100% understand every part, or even remember every part moving forward(that'll take some repetitive action) I really enjoyed knowing how these containers can be... <em>flexed</em>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't have much more to go over. 
                    It's hard to be able to code for an hour or more everyday, as by the time I get to it i'm already so tired. 
                    Luckily I got out of work earlier than normal due to it being slow, and had some time to get some relaxing time in, which has been a well needed thing. 
                    Though on the other hand I honestly think as soon as I sit down at my desk when I get home I need to immediately work on it, if I don't it seems to becomes harder to do with every passing hour. 
                    I need to still be in that "work mode" mind set, as when I start relaxing it just puts me off my top game. 
                    I'm excited to get finished with the freeCodeCamp certificate, but nervous at the same time as to what I'll work on next. 
                    Perhaps once that day is apon me this webpage/site will get an overhaul, somewhat. 
                    I also need to think of some projects and in general things I could build moving forward. 
                    On top of that thought I also will be deep diving into JS at somepoint so that will be a whole other uphill convo to have when I arrive to that point in time.

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 010:</b> <u><em>August 10th 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    So today started off with quite the funny situation. 
                    Within the first 5 minutes of working on fixing my <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects/Survey Form (Mandatory Project)/index.html" target="_blank">Survey Form</a> project I fixed it and it passed... 
                    The issues I was facing were that the top three entry fields; name, email and age, didn't have an id="___" saying what the certification required. 
                    So after adding them, I realized that the two type="radio" buttons, both Yes and No, didn't have a value="" set to them, so if the form were to work it wouldnt put and data through, I'm guessing. 
                    Anyway, like I said it took 5 minutes and I passed. Now about that project on a more personal basis. 
                    I took quite a chunk of the styles.css code(not copy and paste) from Day 8's project: <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects/Registration Form/index.html" target="_blank">Registration Form</a>(as reference code). 
                    Essentially I wrote down the same code in a very similar order as I knew the code worked on the previous page and I honestly only grasped "some" of what it was affecting. 
                    The actual attributes made sense, some foggier than others, but I'm still rolling with training wheels on, so coming up with the way of rebuilding something I already built seemed like way more work than just playing around with what I had already written, tweaking things here and there to see how it changed the output of the page. 
                    That process took me down the path of getting the page to how I wanted and even researching outside methods I had yet to learn through freeCodeCamp to try more of the styling that I wanted to do. 
                    The page is not perfect, even a little. 
                    But with a standard 16/9 monitor the page looks fantastic, once you squeeze the pages sides the background breaks and that was my biggist hurdle I had to move on from and just "accept" as I am limited everyday by time. 
                    Overall I'm proud of the page I built, as I wasnt expecting to make it actually look good, I was worried it would look ugly, somewhat like this blog does right now, I know I can make it better. 
                    But it's only a matter of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now since that required project only took up 5 gosh dang minutes to finish today, I got to work on the first mini project of the next batch of educational material from freeCodeCamp. 
                    This project was solely focused on teaching me the fundementals of how html elements are boxes with layers of adjustable variables that can be places next to eachother and promptly what I image as object kinetic programming. 
                    Now I could be using that term wrong, but in this case I am defining it as the use of these box models as objects that can interact with eachother from either inside or next to other objects on a webpage. 
                    This explanation makes it easier to think about the use and understanding of CSS on a simple level. 
                    Connecting the logic to that of real life, too much for me to explain fully in words here, but I'm sure you understand what I mean. 
                    Now in the <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\CSS Box Model\index.html">Box Model</a> project it focused on building a replica of a painting from scratch. 
                    Albeit a very simple painting but something made from code rather than pixel data, being an img. 
                    Introducing me to attributes like trasform: rotate(), filter: blur(), border-radius, and overflow, all while explainging the padding methods and margin methods of fitting objects into their parent div tag. 
                    I think overall the webpage is ugly yes, but useful in exposing me to new techniques and refreshing me with the same but more digestible ones. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    (<em>Very</em> Personal Section)<br>
                    (Not sure why I needed to say these things, but man I was holding this in)<br>
                    I cannot express how much I want this career change. 
                    Working on this day to day makes me realize it more and more, and I truely feel this is the correct path for me. 
                    Now I don't know if being a web developer is my final "big plan", as I could fall into anything down the line and I'm open to it as long as it has something to do with coding. 
                    I'm having a more difficult time continuing my day job, and I wish I could do this already. 
                    I know I'm not there yet but man, every day really drills it in that I want much more out of life and doing what I'm doing daily is not it. If my current employer happens to read this(as I do show him my efforts in this space, and we are a tech company. we have discussed jr web dev position possibilities etc.) I do enjoy some aspects of what I do, I understand I wasn't hired for anything other than my current position, but for me that just isn't enough for me. 
                    Now I may never get what I am working for at my current job and thats how life goes, but I will get it somewhere at some point. Everyday that goes by I am working towards that. I can't keep cleaning and pulling items for orders, its soul sucking. And honestly I hold the belief that no money value(expect for stupid amounts) can tie me to a job that I don't want to do, so my $17/hr is not nearly enough. With how inflation is going especially where I live, a livable wage is requiring a full "career change". 
                    And I really don't want to continue struggling to pay my bills.
                    I hope this doesn't come off as ungreatful, or anything close to that. 
                    To me it somewhat feels like it does, I know the difficulties of life as of now, I've been through quite a bit and I really want to be successful in my passion. 
                    I'm learning that I am really determined any time I sit down at my desk to code and work on things. 
                    The hours fly by and I don't hate a second of it. 
                    This really has become a passion. 
                    And I mean, it was one back in 2019, had I stuck to it I would be somewhere totally different in my life. 
                    I was dealing with addiction problems back then and even up to earlier this year, relating to a certain legal substance here in my state. 
                    Addiciton can really be a hard thing to deal with when you don't even want it anymore but your body tells you otherwise. 
                    Where you get sick when you go without it, shivers, abdominal pain, and fevers. 
                    The anxiety from every second before I would use it, just to make the sick go away. 
                    And the pure panic when on it. 
                    All I can say now, is I'm out and my life is changing as quickly as I can make it. 
                    ALL for the better. 
                    Sorry this got heavy and seemingly unnecessary, peace and love.
                    <br><br>
                    Thanks for reading! More coding to be done tomorrow :)

                <p>
                    I have run out of time to write a thorough post here for today, but I have started and almost fully completed the 5th Project! 
                    There are only some minor tweaks needing to be made to it for it to pass the "exam" on freeCodeCamp. 
                    You can find the entry made by me for this project <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects/Survey Form (Mandatory Project)/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                    I think it is wonderful, not perfect by any means but it was my best shot for the two hours I put into it. 
                    Now I really must be hasty and get off the computer before my girlfriend... unalives me, so I bid thee fair well untill tomorrow where I'll complete the project and have a checkmark thingy to show off!

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 008:</b> <u><em>August 8th 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    Hello! I worked through the 4th project on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp's</a> Responsive Web Design Course. 
                    And from this section I completed this <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects/Registration Form/index.html" target="_blank">Registration Form</a>. 
                    It took me over and hour and twenty minutes to complete and I ran into <em>some</em> issues during my learning. 
                    It seemed like mostly poor explaining on how many of what kind of things they wanted me to do be be correct, and some other instances it was just me missing a letter/misstype. 
                    Beyond that, the outcome of this effort was quite good, as I now have a great reference source of using html forms(which was my and is still my weak spot) to make a whole page to collect user input data. 
                    Now the real fun begins, well tomorrow and moving forward at least. 
                    The 5th part of this section is the required part for obtaining the Certification from freeCodeCamp. 
                    I'll be working on and making a Survey Form, and I will have a major cheat sheet if needed(the previous form I mentioned just a line or two ago). 
                    I took a peek at it when I completed the registration form and boy is it daunting. 
                    I feel tomorrow will be tough and time consuming, and I am definitely intimidated yet excited to work on it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    OH! and another thing I did recently, after posting Day 7's section, I turned the repository that this site is being saved and commited to into a GitHub Pages page! 
                    So now just about anyone can take a peek at it live and see where I'm at without looking at raw code, which is for the nutty folks out there, but none the less it's really cool they provide this service. 
                    I've used it before in the past, a good... omg, just about 4 years ago or so?! 
                    Way back when I was first getting into coding and when I was enrolled @Lambda School(in DataScienece)(@Bloom Institute, these days). 
                    But anyhow, I'm workin hard, not toooooo hard due to time constraints but I'm showing up everyday to bang out an hour or more, so YAY. 
                    Here's to our ever continuing uphill journey!

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 007:</b> <u><em>August 7th 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    Firstly, HAPPY 1 WEEK OF CODE!!! I held myself to it, and accomplished this first goal of mine, we may <em>only</em> have 93 Days left to go through(realistically it's endless but lets not think about that right now) but this first week has been honestly a lot of fun.
                    I hit the ground much earlier today to finish up this project before I had to go out of the house and do lots of driving. 
                    Finished up the CSS Markers <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects/CSS Color Markers/index.html" target="_blank">page</a> and learned a few more concepts behind the previously mentioned functions, rgb(), hsl() and linear-gradient() and their extra syntax specifications. 
                    Like rgba() hsla() and hex colors being used in a box-shadow. 
                    Speaking of box-shadow, all of the attributes that I have come accross thus far that have these extra value placements in one line are super cool to me and I think they are going to be hard to keep track of!
                    The div displaying is still really new and a tiny bit hard to grasp but I think over time of using them more and more to design pages I'll get use to them. 
                    As well, in this project I needed to put divs next to each other and overall organizing the order of things is still confusing at this time. 
                    I just don't think I've had enough time working with them yet, but I cannot wait to be confident-ish in the use of them in the hopefully near future! 
                    The next project in front of me for the start of week 2(such a cool feeling to be this consistant) is going to be building a registration form, and honestly I really look forward to it. 
                    The whole time earlier in this challenge when I was first introduced to forms, I wondered, how could I really use them in more detail to make something useful. 
                    Now I don't think its going to be any fancy authentication or anything but still I wonder how it will be built to take input data and where it spits it out, to actually be used maybe? 
                    All I do know is I want to have more practice building things like that, and learning about how to securely and safely transfer user data and login information and such accross the web. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Can't wait to get started. 
                    Also I would like to shout out the amazing people and community on twitter who are all super into lifting eachother up and supporting one another. 
                    It's all so motivating to be a part of this challenge and group of like minded people.  
                    So I truely thank you for reading, and or just being you!

                    I ended up working on this hour of code late into the night as my day was full of other things being done and I was just so mentally exhausted that I pushed it back further and further, I wish I had gotten it done super early in the day as I would have been able to go longer and do more. 
                    Possibly leading to better retention of learned material, as I am EXTREMELY tired now... 
                    Anyway, what I got to work doing today was the third project linked <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects/CSS Color Markers/Aug6Post/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                    While unfinished it's teaching the building blocks of digital coloring and color theory of sorts. 
                    Like the rgb() function, hsl() function, along side the inear-gradient() function, working with 90deg, and color function values nested inside. I am looking forward to working more with it tomorrow to get this project finished without beind so tired. 
                    And I regret being in this unfavorable mental space for this day but none the less am excited to push on and get it going tomorrow!

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 005:</b> <u><em>August 5th 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    Today was quite the day, I spent my time working with this website. 
                    Using my new fledgling skills with CSS to make a nice fancy stylesheet. currently the website looks like <a href="images/website_8-5-22.PNG" target="_blank">this</a>. 
                    I am currently very proud and I'm excited to explore what more I can do with CSS to make my site and future projects looks snazzy. 
                    I also updated the other pages on this site(as of current) to use the same stylesheet, making the blog site in total homogeneous is looks. Took me roughly a little over an hour to accomplish, with some extra work after a break inbetween, making it closer to 2hrs. 
                    Not much more to say for today, but tomorrow I expect to persue the next project on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a>. 
                    A difficult thing I'm noticing as of now is the hurdle of organizing my stylesheet and in general I feel somewhat comfortable with my html organization but I'm sure there are issues here as well. 
                    And on top of that I had a tad difficult time figuring out how to properly place all sections of the page to make it look right in its final form. 
                    For awhile I had a floating footer not at the bottom of the page, it was at the bottom of this Home page but on others it was seemingly in the middle having a swell time. 
                    I looked up a tutorial of sorts, simple code snippits conviently from freeCodeCamp's website and got it looking the way I wanted, for the most part. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last minute change before the day ends, I added a twitter hyperlink to the nav bar, check out my tweets throughout this journey or, at least in the future!
                    Anyway I look forward to <b>Day 6</b> See you then!

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 004:</b> <u><em>August 4th 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    I finished the 2nd project on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a> and boy was it a doozie. 
                    Not difficult really, more like a lot of information and some repetitive actions. 
                    Which BTW I was liking, as to me the more you do it the more it will set in! I think? 
                    With the <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\CafeMenu\cafemenu.html" target="_blank">Cafe Menu</a> project complete I feel I have a fairly good understanding of CSS and the quickly intesification that happens with designing pages. 
                    I spent 1.283 hrs (1hr & 17minutes) working on this project, and it may seem like a long time to get that done but as you may have noticed if you've looked around in my github directory for this blog, I'm uploading the files along with completing the project on the websites code editor. 
                    No longer am I, currently, recreating the webpages by putting it side by side with a blank one. 
                    Instead I'm going the route of doing it two times, once on the website or personal editor first then immediately saving it and doing it on the other. 
                    Often times I'd complete it on freecodecamp then re-write the same code onto my own document. 
                    I was basically doing it two times, and I would even write it out on my own before entering it into the website. 
                    Confident enough to save my document before entering it in to see if it actually works, lol.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can see myself getting into CSS and probably being the most overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of stylizations to be made, and having to get use to reading the scripts and properly understanding them at the same time. 
                    And I'm not sure how long it will take for me to look at a document of mine and just "know" what im looking at and what it refferences, I'd say this is my weak spot at this time. 
                    Something I want to get better at, and I want to build some really snazzy sites in the future. 
                    <em>I do have goals of turning this blog page into something way more... readable? and not so basic HTML ugly,</em> in due time but I wanted to throw this out there! For future me!
                    On a side-note I listen to a lot of podcasts on youtube while I'm at work, and they are all related to becoming a web dev, and boot camps and in general the experience people have at said boot camps. 
                    I feel myself falling into this world of different perspectives and options, not knowing if the path im choosing is the right one, or if I'm even capable of making it out to the other side. 
                    I sure hope I will, and feel if I'm not rushing anything I will make it there in due time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well anyway, today has been quite busy and not busy if that makes any sense. 
                    At work it was slow and I was trying to find things to do throughout the day, but right after getting home and taking a breather I hopped right into this project, and very much so enjoyed my time working on it. 
                    Thank you if you happen to be reading this, I know this is mostly for myself, helping to cement the concepts into my head but never the less I enjoy this current form of expression.

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 003:</b> <u><em>August 3rd 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    This day had me doing a few things, my first goal was to try and focus really hard on just getting a little more experience with forms. 
                    So with that goal in mind I made what is now in the top navigation bar, my <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">Contact Page.</a> 
                    Now it doesn't really send the data anywhere but that wasn't my first idea, or even how I wanted it to end up. 
                    At first I wanted to have it setup with a functional way to send the forms data to lets say an email, but as I am not hosting this on a web server and simply just on my pc, the source I was using wouldn't work. 
                    So I opted for the more simple approach for now where it just sends you to a basic landing page, go and give it a shot if you want. 
                    Anyhow after watching videos on this process and building out my form, I went around this site and adjusted some features that were inconsistant on some pages, as well as added new ones!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Which leads me right into what I worked on for the majority of my time spent today, which was around 1.5-2hrs. 
                    I went back onto <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a> and conitnued working on the <u><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">(New)Responsive Web Design</a></u> course. 
                    Started up the next project which was all about making a Cafe Menu page and styling it with CSS, you can check out my progress <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\CafeMenu\Aug3rdPost\cafemenu.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                    Its <b>SUPER</b> simple as of now but this is about as far as I could get with the time I had allocated today. 
                    And I was familiar with the vague layout/format of CSS, which comes from way back in 2018 when I was exploring web dev education for my first time. 
                    I use to watch a lot of a youtuber named Stefan Mischook on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/StefanMischook" target="_blank">YouTube page</a>, and actually bought a course from his website to learn how to code HTML, CSS and JS. 
                    I'll say that now reflecting on that is fuzzy but the underlying "brickwork" is there as my starting foundation and I feel this wont be as difficult as it could have been if I was still a complete novice. 
                    The linking process is probably the most important part of todays journey as that was the foggy mystery I needed to relearn as I had forgotten "how does a css page even connect to this html one?". 
                    Overall with this challenge and making these posts everyday, I feel good about what I have accomplished even if I wish it was more I doubt I would be able to retain it. 
                    I know I can build more and don't get me wrong it is quite... looming to think of all the information I need to get use to, but I'm here for it! Here's to the next 97 Days!

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 002:</b> <u><em>August 2nd 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    Today was quite the busy day, and to explain why will require some filler of my back story. 
                    So in my day to day life I work at a local ecommerce brick and mortor, that also does tech support for the area. 
                    I<em>(22)</em> live at home with my Brother<em>(soon to be 21)</em> and my Girlfriend<em>(20)</em>. 
                    My mother use to not so long ago live with us at our house, which is more of a townhome apartment building, but since recent has been staying in the same town she works in day to day. 
                    Every weekend, typically saturday, I drive down to where she stays and we go shopping for her grocries and spend some time together. 
                    And roughly once every 3 weeks I drive down to pick her up and bring her to our place for the week. 
                    Well that's what I did today, that driving part, so right after work I drove down(1.5hrs) to her and picked her up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My car, which is actually her car but is a longer story and honestly TL;DR, starts having some issues and we need to take a pitstop and let it sit for a brief amount of time. 
                    We head to our predestined location, a fast food joint! 
                    And we go in to grab a snack while we wait, I had already promised my Girlfriend that I would pick her up a lemonaide to bring back, my mom got some fries and a cookie to enjoy. 
                    Needless to say I left work at basically 4pm and arrived back home at 7pm. 
                    I start work everyday at 8:30am and really like to get plently of sleep so I had to quickly make dinner and get myself upstairs onto my computer to continue the <b><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfCode&src=typeahead_click" target="_blank">#100DaysOfCode</a></b> <b><a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/" target="_blank">Challenge!</a></b>
                    so I made this! This webpage is what I am using currently to <em>"blog"</em> about this coding challenge and where it takes me. 
                    So I've spent the past lil over an hour working on this, writing up everything I think I should put in it, and this is the result!

                    I will continue to work on this webpage after every session to fillout what I did that day, keeping a log of each step and difficult thing I came accross, and show that I can overcome them! 
                    It definitely helps that when I express dificulty with something during this challenge that I will have it logged and know what to focus more of my learning time on practicing. 
                    Thanks for reading!

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 001:</b> <u><em>August 1st 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    I started on freecodecamp and entered into the <u><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">(New)Responsive Web Design Certification</a></u>. 
                    After completing the course in roughly an hour or longer, I cannot remember as I was "in the zone", I decided I wanted to continue practicing the new information that was fresh in my mind. 
                    I took the now finished page and loaded it onto half of my lefthand monitor, one of my two total monitors, and then put a fresh .html file next to it. 
                    I used the loaded premade page as reference and did my very best to replicate the work onto the new .html file without just completely copying the straight up code line by line. 
                    After I got down past the first list I got stuck with the figure tag and figcaption part of the page, more so I forgot how I implemented those images with added text underneath.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I then got to what for me was the most "forgotten" part of this first project. 
                    <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\CatPhotoApp\CatPhotoApp.html" target="_blank">The Cat Form</a>, or in general, html forms with attributes, buttons, inputs, so many parts. 
                    I ended up peeking at the original reference page's html code to refresh my memory on what it was suppose to be. 
                    This then was leading me to remember enough parts to piece the rest of the buttons and labels together. 
                    I know looking back at it wonder in what way can I setup the part of this project myself that receives the submit field information, like where does it go? 
                    And how can I use it? 
                    Much to learn and lots to practice. 
                    I am grately looking forward to it!
