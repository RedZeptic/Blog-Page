                    <p><b>Day 007:</b> <u><em>August 7th 2022:</em></u><br>
                        Firstly, HAPPY 1 WEEK OF CODE!!! I held myself to it, and accomplished this first goal of mine, we may <em>only</em> have 93 Days left to go through(realistically it's endless but lets not think about that right now) but this first week has been honestly a lot of fun.
                        I hit the ground much earlier today to finish up this project before I had to go out of the house and do lots of driving. 
                        Finished up the CSS Markers <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects/CSS Color Markers/index.html" target="_blank">page</a> and learned a few more concepts behind the previously mentioned functions, rgb(), hsl() and linear-gradient() and their extra syntax specifications. 
                        Like rgba() hsla() and hex colors being used in a box-shadow. 
                        Speaking of box-shadow, all of the attributes that I have come accross thus far that have these extra value placements in one line are super cool to me and I think they are going to be hard to keep track of!
                        The div displaying is still really new and a tiny bit hard to grasp but I think over time of using them more and more to design pages I'll get use to them. 
                        As well, in this project I needed to put divs next to each other and overall organizing the order of things is still confusing at this time. 
                        I just don't think I've had enough time working with them yet, but I cannot wait to be confident-ish in the use of them in the hopefully near future! 
                        The next project in front of me for the start of week 2(such a cool feeling to be this consistant) is going to be building a registration form, and honestly I really look forward to it. 
                        The whole time earlier in this challenge when I was first introduced to forms, I wondered, how could I really use them in more detail to make something useful. 
                        Now I don't think its going to be any fancy authentication or anything but still I wonder how it will be built to take input data and where it spits it out, to actually be used maybe? 
                        All I do know is I want to have more practice building things like that, and learning about how to securely and safely transfer user data and login information and such accross the web. 
                        <br><br>
                        Can't wait to get started. 
                        Also I would like to shout out the amazing people and community on twitter who are all super into lifting eachother up and supporting one another. 
                        It's all so motivating to be a part of this challenge and group of like minded people.  
                        So I truely thank you for reading, and or just being you!

                    <p><b>Day 006:</b> <u><em>August 6th 2022:</em></u><br>
                        I ended up working on this hour of code late into the night as my day was full of other things being done and I was just so mentally exhausted that I pushed it back further and further, I wish I had gotten it done super early in the day as I would have been able to go longer and do more. 
                        Possibly leading to better retention of learned material, as I am EXTREMELY tired now... 
                        Anyway, what I got to work doing today was the third project linked <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects/CSS Color Markers/Aug6Post/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                        While unfinished it's teaching the building blocks of digital coloring and color theory of sorts. 
                        Like the rgb() function, hsl() function, along side the inear-gradient() function, working with 90deg, and color function values nested inside. I am looking forward to working more with it tomorrow to get this project finished without beind so tired. 
                        And I regret being in this unfavorable mental space for this day but none the less am excited to push on and get it going tomorrow!

                    <p><b>Day 005:</b> <u><em>August 5th 2022:</em></u><br>
                        Today was quite the day, I spent my time working with this website. 
                        Using my new fledgling skills with CSS to make a nice fancy stylesheet. currently the website looks like <a href="images/website_8-5-22.PNG" target="_blank">this</a>. 
                        I am currently very proud and I'm excited to explore what more I can do with CSS to make my site and future projects looks snazzy. 
                        I also updated the other pages on this site(as of current) to use the same stylesheet, making the blog site in total homogeneous is looks. Took me roughly a little over an hour to accomplish, with some extra work after a break inbetween, making it closer to 2hrs. 
                        Not much more to say for today, but tomorrow I expect to persue the next project on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a>. 
                        A difficult thing I'm noticing as of now is the hurdle of organizing my stylesheet and in general I feel somewhat comfortable with my html organization but I'm sure there are issues here as well. 
                        And on top of that I had a tad difficult time figuring out how to properly place all sections of the page to make it look right in its final form. 
                        For awhile I had a floating footer not at the bottom of the page, it was at the bottom of this Home page but on others it was seemingly in the middle having a swell time. 
                        I looked up a tutorial of sorts, simple code snippits conviently from freeCodeCamp's website and got it looking the way I wanted, for the most part. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Last minute change before the day ends, I added a twitter hyperlink to the nav bar, check out my tweets throughout this journey or, at least in the future!
                        Anyway I look forward to <b>Day 6</b> See you then!

                    <p><b>Day 004:</b> <u><em>August 4th 2022:</em></u><br>
                        I finished the 2nd project on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a> and boy was it a doozie. 
                        Not difficult really, more like a lot of information and some repetitive actions. 
                        Which BTW I was liking, as to me the more you do it the more it will set in! I think? 
                        With the <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\CafeMenu\cafemenu.html" target="_blank">Cafe Menu</a> project complete I feel I have a fairly good understanding of CSS and the quickly intesification that happens with designing pages. 
                        I spent 1.283 hrs (1hr & 17minutes) working on this project, and it may seem like a long time to get that done but as you may have noticed if you've looked around in my github directory for this blog, I'm uploading the files along with completing the project on the websites code editor. 
                        No longer am I, currently, recreating the webpages by putting it side by side with a blank one. 
                        Instead I'm going the route of doing it two times, once on the website or personal editor first then immediately saving it and doing it on the other. 
                        Often times I'd complete it on freecodecamp then re-write the same code onto my own document. 
                        I was basically doing it two times, and I would even write it out on my own before entering it into the website. 
                        Confident enough to save my document before entering it in to see if it actually works, lol.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I can see myself getting into CSS and probably being the most overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of stylizations to be made, and having to get use to reading the scripts and properly understanding them at the same time. 
                        And I'm not sure how long it will take for me to look at a document of mine and just "know" what im looking at and what it refferences, I'd say this is my weak spot at this time. 
                        Something I want to get better at, and I want to build some really snazzy sites in the future. 
                        <em>I do have goals of turning this blog page into something way more... readable? and not so basic HTML ugly,</em> in due time but I wanted to throw this out there! For future me!
                        On a side-note I listen to a lot of podcasts on youtube while I'm at work, and they are all related to becoming a web dev, and boot camps and in general the experience people have at said boot camps. 
                        I feel myself falling into this world of different perspectives and options, not knowing if the path im choosing is the right one, or if I'm even capable of making it out to the other side. 
                        I sure hope I will, and feel if I'm not rushing anything I will make it there in due time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well anyway, today has been quite busy and not busy if that makes any sense. 
                        At work it was slow and I was trying to find things to do throughout the day, but right after getting home and taking a breather I hopped right into this project, and very much so enjoyed my time working on it. 
                        Thank you if you happen to be reading this, I know this is mostly for myself, helping to cement the concepts into my head but never the less I enjoy this current form of expression.

                    <p><b>Day 003:</b> <u><em>August 3rd 2022:</em></u><br>
                        This day had me doing a few things, my first goal was to try and focus really hard on just getting a little more experience with forms. 
                        So with that goal in mind I made what is now in the top navigation bar, my <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">Contact Page.</a> 
                        Now it doesn't really send the data anywhere but that wasn't my first idea, or even how I wanted it to end up. 
                        At first I wanted to have it setup with a functional way to send the forms data to lets say an email, but as I am not hosting this on a web server and simply just on my pc, the source I was using wouldn't work. 
                        So I opted for the more simple approach for now where it just sends you to a basic landing page, go and give it a shot if you want. 
                        Anyhow after watching videos on this process and building out my form, I went around this site and adjusted some features that were inconsistant on some pages, as well as added new ones!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Which leads me right into what I worked on for the majority of my time spent today, which was around 1.5-2hrs. 
                        I went back onto <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a> and conitnued working on the <u><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">(New)Responsive Web Design</a></u> course. 
                        Started up the next project which was all about making a Cafe Menu page and styling it with CSS, you can check out my progress <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\CafeMenu\Aug3rdPost\cafemenu.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                        Its <b>SUPER</b> simple as of now but this is about as far as I could get with the time I had allocated today. 
                        And I was familiar with the vague layout/format of CSS, which comes from way back in 2018 when I was exploring web dev education for my first time. 
                        I use to watch a lot of a youtuber named Stefan Mischook on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/StefanMischook" target="_blank">YouTube page</a>, and actually bought a course from his website to learn how to code HTML, CSS and JS. 
                        I'll say that now reflecting on that is fuzzy but the underlying "brickwork" is there as my starting foundation and I feel this wont be as difficult as it could have been if I was still a complete novice. 
                        The linking process is probably the most important part of todays journey as that was the foggy mystery I needed to relearn as I had forgotten "how does a css page even connect to this html one?". 
                        Overall with this challenge and making these posts everyday, I feel good about what I have accomplished even if I wish it was more I doubt I would be able to retain it. 
                        I know I can build more and don't get me wrong it is quite... looming to think of all the information I need to get use to, but I'm here for it! Here's to the next 97 Days!

                    <p><b>Day 002:</b> <u><em>August 2st 2022:</em></u><br>
                        Today was quite the busy day, and to explain why will require some filler of my back story. 
                        So in my day to day life I work at a local ecommerce brick and mortor, that also does tech support for the area. 
                        I<em>(22)</em> live at home with my Brother<em>(soon to be 21)</em> and my Girlfriend<em>(20)</em>. 
                        My mother use to not so long ago live with us at our house, which is more of a townhome apartment building, but since recent has been staying in the same town she works in day to day. 
                        Every weekend, typically saturday, I drive down to where she stays and we go shopping for her grocries and spend some time together. 
                        And roughly once every 3 weeks I drive down to pick her up and bring her to our place for the week. 
                        Well that's what I did today, that driving part, so right after work I drove down(1.5hrs) to her and picked her up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My car, which is actually her car but is a longer story and honestly TL;DR, starts having some issues and we need to take a pitstop and let it sit for a brief amount of time. 
                        We head to our predestined location, a fast food joint! 
                        And we go in to grab a snack while we wait, I had already promised my Girlfriend that I would pick her up a lemonaide to bring back, my mom got some fries and a cookie to enjoy. 
                        Needless to say I left work at basically 4pm and arrived back home at 7pm. 
                        I start work everyday at 8:30am and really like to get plently of sleep so I had to quickly make dinner and get myself upstairs onto my computer to continue the <b><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfCode&src=typeahead_click" target="_blank">#100DaysOfCode</a></b> <b><a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/" target="_blank">Challenge!</a></b>
                        so I made this! This webpage is what I am using currently to <em>"blog"</em> about this coding challenge and where it takes me. 
                        So I've spent the past lil over an hour working on this, writing up everything I think I should put in it, and this is the result!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I will continue to work on this webpage after every session to fillout what I did that day, keeping a log of each step and difficult thing I came accross, and show that I can overcome them! 
                        It definitely helps that when I express dificulty with something during this challenge that I will have it logged and know what to focus more of my learning time on practicing. 
                        Thanks for reading!

                    <p><b>Day 001:</b> <u><em>August 1st 2022:</em></u><br>
                        I started on freecodecamp and entered into the <u><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">(New)Responsive Web Design Certification</a></u>. 
                        After completing the course in roughly an hour or longer, I cannot remember as I was "in the zone", I decided I wanted to continue practicing the new information that was fresh in my mind. 
                        I took the now finished page and loaded it onto half of my lefthand monitor, one of my two total monitors, and then put a fresh .html file next to it. 
                        I used the loaded premade page as reference and did my very best to replicate the work onto the new .html file without just completely copying the straight up code line by line. 
                        After I got down past the first list I got stuck with the figure tag and figcaption part of the page, more so I forgot how I implemented those images with added text underneath.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I then got to what for me was the most "forgotten" part of this first project. 
                        <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\CatPhotoApp\CatPhotoApp.html" target="_blank">The Cat Form</a>, or in general, html forms with attributes, buttons, inputs, so many parts. 
                        I ended up peeking at the original reference page's html code to refresh my memory on what it was suppose to be. 
                        This then was leading me to remember enough parts to piece the rest of the buttons and labels together. 
                        I know looking back at it wonder in what way can I setup the part of this project myself that receives the submit field information, like where does it go? 
                        And how can I use it? 
                        Much to learn and lots to practice. 
                        I am grately looking forward to it!
