                        I got my tattoo today, had very little time I could spend working on my <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Documentation\Aug25Post\index.html">Documentation Page</a>, but I ironed out some of the issues with it, but I still have more work to do tomorrow to get it to pass the freeCodeCamp tests.
                        I made it definitely look better, much closer to the reference page. 
                        My biggest challenges with this page so far have be putting aspects of the page into different sections, the nav bar and main section of the page being side by side being the hardest. 
                        Then needing to make the page jump anchor tags not be all wonky with weird placement but I, after looking over the reference css code, notice I had some un needed padding that was causing that to happen. 
                        Seems I add things to weird spots when I don't need to, and not put them in the spots they are more logically needed. 
                        I'll get the hang of it soon!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm really tired, and need to wash my tattoo site, and head to bed so I'll catch back up with this tomorrow!

                    <p>
                        Today I started and got almost all the way done on the <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Documentation\Aug24Post\index.html">Documentation Page Project</a>. 
                        At the beggining it was a lot of setting up the structure of the page to match the visual layout of the reference page they provide at the top of the challenge. 
                        I intentionally wanted the page to be as identical as possible due to the fact that my last manditory project wasn't and it was way more work than I wanted to make my own themed one. 
                        Not that I don't need the practice making my own, but sourcing the material is just not what I need to spend my time doing when my time is so limited each day. 
                        Another aspect of my version of the page is that in its current state it has colors showing me the size and layout of the navbar sections. 
                        I'm currently trying to figure out how to get those border-top's to reach all the way to the left side of the screen where there are "list-style-type: none" / "list-style: none" bullet points. 
                        I don't know how to make them go away, I think it might be something with "overflow: hidden;" but I ran out of time right before I could solve that, so I'm forced to leave it to tomorrow, or the next day depending on how my tattoo session goes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Relating to the documentation page, I did take some peaks at how the page was setup for its nav bar, and I had guessed prior to looking "is it a unordered list and list items?" which was the correct answer once I saw the multitude of close tabbed list elements within the inspect element feature on chrome. 
                        I had put a "h1" for the main title of the page, but when I saw the reference pages banner title being a header I swapped over to that. 
                        The consistancy of using headers accross the entire page for this use makes a lot of sense, so I don't know why I would want to use a h1 over a header, being almost the same element. 
                        When I get the time, I will of course remove the colors from the page, recolor the text to a dark gray, change the navbar links to not have their decorations and also make their hover, and visited, event not change any colors. 
                        I need to put a lightly blue colored box with rounded edges, which would be border-radius if im not mistaken, to put the "< code >< /code >" into. 
                        Spacing it out appropriately with padding I presume. 
                        Back to the navbar, it is in great need of being fixed to the webpages view but that problem is quite complex at this moment so I have yet to attack it head on to get the navbar menu to travel with the viewer up and down the page without the main sections content being put underneath the navbar, hiding crucial information needing to be viewed. 
                        At least if I want the page to be as close to the reference as possible. 
                        Again, I am trying to do that without looking at the reference code, there would be no point in any of this if I spoiled my problem solving skills by copying it line for line. 
                        I mean, I want this as a perfession and I don't think I would be doing myself any favors by taking the easy way out. 
                        Not really the easy way either, as in the end I cannot solve my problems I come accross thus leading to everything being the hard way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also noticed when loading up my blog-page on mobile that some stuff is broken... I'll fix that when I can! lol. 
                        That's all I got for today, take care and I'll update this tomorrow with more information as to where I'm at!

                    <p>
                        I got today kicked off by completing the <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Piano\index.html">Piano page</a> and I really enjoyed some parts of this one! 
                        With a lot of these concepts still being super vague to me as how I would come up with them to know when to use them on my own, I found the @media part really cool. 
                        Without any guidance on how it really works(from freeCodeCamp) after looking up the documentation to it, I was, am still amazed by the simplicity and "coolness" of it. 
                        Using it to make logical statements for styling made me giggle with sheer "awwhhh" and gitty excitement. 
                        I'm not sure why learning that you can make a @media tag and make it it's own whole styling sheet blew me away but it did. 
                        Gaining actual enjoyment from learning that, which is a first in awhile. 
                        These tutorials have been a lot of do this do that, and bam it's done with no real... substance to show you the might of the cool tools!
                        I also recolored the piano page, I simply disliked the green colored piano and white background. 
                        So I made it closer to my own. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now on the horizon for the next few days(if it takes that long) is the next manditory project for the freeCodeCamp certification. 
                        I'll be building a documentation page, and just from the sound of it I think it might be a doozy. 
                        Granted I could be wrong but so far these manditory projects have been the most fun, and the most effort. 
                        I've have the occasional non manditory project that almost puts me to sleep because its repetitive and awfully boring, the painting ones were this for me. 
                        I've noticed since yesterday when I was working on this webpage and stylesheet, making it better organized and nicer to look at, that I really enjoy working on projects that are not tutorials. 
                        Like I feel genuine pleasure and satisfaction from playing around and trying new things to get something to work. 
                        Not always succeeding but I am still very new to this. And after the slump I was/am in over the past few days, I feel if I chase this feeling it will be a great choice for me. 
                        Now this kind of sounds like I want to not follow tutorials and what not, but thats not the case. 
                        I still need to learn and want to accomplish these learn by doing projects. 
                        And I cannot think of a better way to get use to coding often and exposing myself to new concepts. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So far today was a good day(minus the work section of it - lol). 
                        I'm trying to keep a good mindset that my Mom has taught me, that this[my job] is allowing me to get to where I want to be, and do what I want to do. 
                        It helps a bit to get through the large portion of my day, and I really and shifting my mentality of sitting down to code into "man I really wanna get home and code". 
                        Learning new things is never easy, and coding falls right into that basket. 
                        I put so much stress and pressure onto myself that it ends up looming over me, when I should just try and enjoy it. 
                        What rush am I in really, to make myself this stressed out.

                        I completed the <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Picasso Painting\index.html">Picasso Page</a>, and honestly a lot of this project was "in one year out the other". 
                        Simply due to the fact that I had a busy past few days and this was, to me, not a super interesting project. 
                        Like the outcome is pretty ugly, but the teachings are being repitiously imprinted into me so that's probably the best part I suppose. 
                        I feel familiar with most aspects of the code but still a little distant on how I could actively plan to use these techniques myself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I spent earlier in the day(while at work) listening to some coding podcasts talking about how to better direct your Linkdin profile and how to network with the devoloper community. 
                        Gaining some great tips for making connections, that I'm sure I'll use when I'm closer to competent. 
                        On another note, I have been a certain type of typist when it comes to how I input with my keyboard, being a mixture between a index tapper and a full hand typer. 
                        I intend on practicing my typing to get better at being a more skilled typer, allowing me to be able to type without making as many mistakes(hopefully!). 
                    </p>
                    <p><em>Appended:</em> I updated the look of this page, and I think its nicer now :)</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Personal Section:</b> Today was really tough getting up and going into work. 
                        I constantly felt like not showing up there ever again, parts of the atmosphere there makes me super uncomfortable and the tasks themselves are not something I find any amount of pride in. 
                        I'm a sensitive person and when I feel any specific emotion it's usually very powerful. 
                        Dredding going to work, and do something I don't like, be around people who are negative and soul sucking, really hits me hard on my mental health. 
                        At this same time I'm searching and racking my head trying to figure a way out of this and a way into something I really am interested in and passionate about. 
                        But also being doubtful of myself in whatever options I lay out for myself. 
                        I think I may want to go into entrepreneurship or down a path similar to that, but again, I feel some strong imposter vibes coming my way. 
                        I'm feeling stuck, trapped, and kept in this routine by bills, and looming responsibilities. 
                        I know I will find some way, but during this finding part of that it is really bleak and depressing. 
                        A thing I think about a lot is that I don't have much of if any quality down time, I use to get that from playing video games. 
                        But now I feel all I do is watch youtube, stress about the next workday ahead of me and make myself work on my coding education(which I want to do, but having the energy is a real B sometimes).
                        <b>TL;DR:</b> Life recurringly has felt gaping and baseless, devoid of true quality and sense of comfort. I'm doing my best to work through it, and I want to make it better for myself. 
                        Even with being unsure as to how to do that, I want to feel fulfilled and will try my best to get there.

                        Today I got a bit more progress done on the <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Picasso Painting\Aug21Post\index.html">Piccaso Painting</a> page. 
                        Almost finishing it, but I ran out of time. 
                        It's exposing me to more CSS techniques that are more on the side of the way to do things rather than how to do them, if that makes sense. 
                        Also exposing me to symbols and different ways of moving colored objects around the screen. 
                        I'm still rather tired from yesterday so this is enough for me, on to tomorrow.

                        I just got back from being out all day on a family trip, I didn't have much time to code but I got some time in early this morning before leaving the house. 
                        I got a little bit into the next project and you can see <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Picasso Painting\Aug20Post\index.html">that here</a>. 
                        Now I am so exhausted I have no more energy to put into this blog post, I drove so much, was out all day. 
                        I feel I could collapse at any moment, so gnite! and I'll check back in tomorrow for day 21!

                        Today I completed the <a target="_blank" href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Balance Sheet\index.html">Balance Sheet</a>. 
                        I have so little energy today to mentally get through this, taking short pauses every 10 steps or so. 
                        I really have been feeling burnt on this whole process up to today. 
                        Things in my day to day life have been affecting my mood and this combined with me running out of steam early today. 
                        I'll say this, I learned of some new ways to address classes, moreover why I would want to use this method. 
                        the element[class=""] is used to pick out a specific element that only contains that class and no other, while the element.classname chooses every element that has that class included, even if it has others too. 
                        Beyond that I used more attributes that move text around, and loads of other things that feel fuzzy in my head. 
                        So much information and so little energy to want to dive into understanding them.
                    </p>

                        Tomorrow Day 20, I am going on a family trip, it's a one day trip but I am going to be gone for quite awhile at a waterpark. 
                        I am extremely unsure of how I will get coding done tomorrow but at the end of the day I will still try. 
                        If push comes to shove, I may have to stop this challenge but I also might be able to do something less intense once I'm back home. 
                        We'll see.

                        I started working on a <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Balance Sheet\Aug18Post\index.html" target="_blank">Balance Sheet</a> (not done, 50% there) page today using html tables and setting it up for screen reader help. 
                        Here are some of the elements I used today, ones I'm still new to using:
                    </p>
                    <p>HTML</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_table.asp" target="_blank">< table ></a>, the tag responsible for building out a table in html. Similar to any container tag, but only for tables.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_caption.asp#:~:text=Definition%20and%20Usage,align%20and%20place%20the%20caption." target="_blank">< caption ></a>, this tag is required to be the first in the table tag, and defines a text caption for the table.</li>

                        I have plenty of work to do to finish this page up, and I'm getting tired. 
                        Doing this every day is tough! 
                        But the show must go on. 
                        I have not much left to mention or things I want to talk about, but I'm starting to feel like all of this information is a lot and its difficult to absorb. 
                        I never expected to be able to retain everything, and I have retained quite a good amount, but man so much information and following directions for so long makes my energy tumble. 
                        Till tomorrow!

                    <p>
                        Just like I said yesterday, I completed the project! the fixes were simple and the misstakes we of my own doing. 
                        I made the project almost perfect the first time (yesterday) but my image id was <b>img</b> when it should have been <b>image</b>. 
                        And a few other issues but you can see my final version of the <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Tribute Page (Manditory Project)\index.html" target="_blank">Tribute Page here</a>. 
                        Took awhile doing the research part of it, and probably not enough time to make sure the info is perfect but I'm working with what I got! 
                        The topic of choice is an activist I follow and enjoy watching their content. 
                        I also follow the same principles that they layout in their videos.
                    <p>
                        But beyond that, I've been listening to a lot of podcasts relating to web developers and boot camps(I cannot attend a boot camp due to life stuff) and It makes me really want to network out and make some friends. 
                        But that is surprise, surprise, hard. 
                        I'm open to connections, talking with fresh newbie devs like myself, all the way up to devs that know their shit. 
                        Over the next couple weeks I'm going to be in a more difficult posting with coding everyday due to a new tattoo im getting on Day 25, so there is a good chance my progress on that day will be limited. 
                        But also from that my speed at which I type will be (I think) inhibited a little bit, due to the placement of the t once I have that tattoo, even networking will be hard, and I feel at this current stage being only 17 days in my ability to find someone to talk to who would want to talk with me will be hard. 
                        I'm not even sure what we'd talk about really... I mean obviously code and stuff but, the how is my current quandary. attoo. 
                        My main point with this is,
                        Any how, I'm proud of this step, I've passed the 2nd manditory project for the certificate, meaning im <a href="images\fCC-40percent.PNG" target="_blank">40% there!</a> 
                        Once finished I'll move on the The Odin Project, at the recommendation of Michael White Dev on YT, he's pretty cool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        See you tomorrow!

                    <p>
                        Today was all about tackling the challenge to make a <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Tribute Page (Manditory Project)\Aug16Post\index.html" target="_blank">tribute page</a>, so far I wasn't able to get it to pass freeCodeCamp's test but IMO its looking great! 
                        Now after running the code through freeCodeCamp's tester I now know what I need to work on to get it to fit their standards. 
                        I did deviate away from the simplicity of what they wanted and I'm sure some of the choices I made took the code out of the passing score. 
                        There were also a few things that weren't told to me, like putting some img caption in its own div, I made it work without doing that. 
                        But alas I will be required to do some rework and get it meeting the given standards. 
                        The project has been quite fun so far, and honestly the time flew by, I could just keep working on it longer but I'm at my time limit end! 
                        There is not much I learned today, as it's been practice and solving small problems. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The topic for my tribute page is on a fellow vegan who does loads of activism and content online, I look up to him and his story is quite the tale. 
                        This project made me choose something to make the page about, and I could have totally made it, something I'm able to make up for the sake of doing. 
                        But that didn't seem right to me, so I based it on something real, and someone who I don't personally know, and is not super well documented(unlike historical figures who have passed away).
                        That's all I have to share, thank you for reading. 
                        Tomorrow this page should be complete and we can get a good look at them side by side!

                        Today after throwing on some calm ambience from a specific video game from 2011, I put my nose to the grindstone and smashed out the project I was having issues with yesterday. 
                        I just needed to suck up the fact that it is how it is, and push on! 
                        So here is the <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Building a Quiz\index.html" target="_blank">completed version</a> of what I worked on. 
                        I completed like 40 some odd steps today, and learned about some new things that I hadn't gone over before thus far in the course. 
                        I have them sorted into two lists, one from HTML and one from CSS.     
                    </p>
                    <p>HTML</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_address.asp" target="_blank">< address ></a> tag, being a tag to put your site / resorce address info in a footer as an example.</li>
                        <li>The <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_accesskey.asp#:~:text=The%20accesskey%20attribute%20specifies%20a,to%20activate%2Ffocus%20an%20element.&text=However%2C%20in%20most%20browsers%20the,access%20key%20will%20be%20activated" target="_blank">accesskey=""</a> feature. allowing easy access to sections of the page based on keystrokes.</li>
                        <li>refreshing me on the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_for.asp" target="_blank">for=""</a> attribute, marking a linkage between a label and an input.</li>
                        <li>the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby" target="_blank">aria-labelledby=""</a> attribute which was never explained. Simply its to reference a interactive element with a identifying name for the user.</li>
                        <li>the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-role-attribute/#:~:text=The%20role%20attribute%20describes%20the,as%20screen%20readers%20or%20magnifiers.&text=Screen%20Readers%20will%20read%20this,%E2%80%9D%20instead%20of%20%E2%80%9Clink%E2%80%9D." target="_blank">role=""</a> attribute being a way to make a screen reader view a element as a specific other element/region.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>CSS</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio" target="_blank">aspect-ratio:__</a> which controls the aspect ratio of the given element it is affecting.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp" target="_blank">@media</a> rule which was not really explained well, and I will probably learn more about later.</li>
                        <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before" target="_blank">::before</a> pseudo-element selecting the first child of the given element. <em>ex. p::before.</em></li>
                        <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button" target="_blank">< button ></a> element being... well a button.</li>
                        <li>And lastly just getting refreshed on using flexbox, like the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content" target="_blank">justify-content</a> property, which helps the browser distribute the space between objects(content) along the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Main_Axis" target="_blank">main-axis</a> of a flex container.</li>
                        <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-behavior" target="_blank">scroll-behavior</a> property which sets the type of scrolling animation(through APIs) for navigating the regions with accesskey binds or inpage hyperlinks.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        That's just about it! 
                        Tomorrow marks a big day, or days. 
                        As it is when I start the next manditory project for the certification. 
                        I'm excited and anxious about the difficulty of it, but never the less I am feeling ready to tackle it, with out without the knowledge that freeCodeCamp has or hasn't given me! 
                        Wish me the best!

                        Two weeks in and I'm finally getting pissed off(a little exagerated) at freeCodeCamp's step prompts occasionally leaving out parts it wants you to put. 
                        Now I understand the whole bit of "research to figure out whats wrong" but they give a hint... and yes sure that's helpful, but you could just show me how to do that in the first place, and I'd have a reference to come back to in the future, rather than just not giving me a reason behind why something fails to their expectations. 
                        Overall their instructions are lackluster, and only sometimes when they word their "hey do this" in a specific way that doesn't give you the answer but has you figure out how to do it, then it's great, and it feels like I figured it out myself. 
                        Essentially it's holding your hand through the projects, expecting you to know the next step without showing you how to take it, and then telling you be nudging you and gesturing to themselves, showing you in very basic ways what you need/are forgetting(how can I forget if I never knew it in the first place?).
                        Also with the way they say how to do things, or actually what order to do them in. 
                        It will tell you to put this tag in, and nest this one, and add this other one. 
                        And when you do that, it errors! 
                        Tells you a not so helpful hint, and then you just look at the code, move something around and then its like yeah thats good! 
                        The great side of freeCodeCamp so far has been the project based learning, and I've learned quite a bit more than I knew before. 
                        Their execution is somewhat not fitting my style of learning but I will push on to complete all of the projects to get the certification.

                    <p>
                        Today I worked on the <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Building a Quiz\Aug14Post\index.html" target="_blank">Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz project</a>. 
                        It was a difficult one for some of the mentioned issues with the teaching method stated in the above paragraph, but overall the actual code itself makes sense. 
                        Connecting labels and inputs together, adding screen reader only classes with their respective attributes that make knowing what something on the screen is without people who can see it... well seeing it. 
                        The method of a form being "Post" which I had to look up to actually know what it does, and wasnt told to add it... so the hint was the only way for me to know I needed it. 
                        I did however really like the nav bar, there are some sizing issues when scaling the page but the project isn't dont yet anyway. 
                        The style of it was really nice and I like the layout, I'm inspired for this webpage to look as nice. 
                        This was also my first exposure to using aspect-ratio:__ and I'm happy to know of it now, as well as using the max() and min() size functions in CSS. 
                        Nothing more to add to this post, so I'll finish this project up on Day 15!

                    <p>
                        I finished working on the <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Typography Nutrition Label\index.html" target="_blank">Nutrition Label</a> today, after a long day of driving and being far from home. 
                        I swear I am so the kind of person that I could stay home and never leave and probably be fine. 
                        Energy wise, I'm tapped. 
                        I pushed through that though, and smashed out this project, really just getting the ideas of dividers and multiple classes affecting specific tags. 
                        I still think that's super cool and quite powerful! 
                        I still feel quite disorganized when working on these projects. 
                        More over, I feel once I am not following a guide I will find it difficult to remember everything I've done on them, and maybe fall into some bad organization? 
                        Thankfully I have the projects saved here as a piece of this blog and repository, and I can always look back at the source code to refresh myself on any specific thing I've done before. 
                        Being almost 2 weeks in its getting quite complicated. 
                        But I may only be feeling this way due to every time I start coding it's later in the day and my ability to think and comprehend becomes slower. 
                        I wish I could do this earlier in the day every day but that doesnt seem like a possibility, maybe tomorrow? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I can't wait to revamp this blog site with more details and style in a few weeks(best guess). 
                        Making this look super pretty-ish is the goal and it will be so nice compared to the current gray style.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On a complete left turn of this conversation, I've been wanting to get a tattoo for awhile now. 
                        And while out today I went and scheduled to get one of my own design in a few weeks. 
                        It's going to be put on my right forearm, and is an original design spelling out VEGAN, repping my ethical beliefs on my arm, solid black ink. 
                        I'm excited and just wanted to share. 
                        This will be my first tattoo and I can't wait to get it. 
                        Maybe once is on me I'll show it off, as the design(imo) looks very clean and nice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow marks 2 weeks, almost time for celebration! that leaves me with 86 more days! And maybe more!? 
                        Honestly I don't know but I want a career in this field so, likely ain't stopping anytime soon.

                        I worked on the next project from freeCodeCamp, you can see my progress <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Typography Nutrition Label\Aug12Post\index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. I don't have too much to say on it, besides the amazing fact that you can target specific classes and apply multiple classes to different elements! 
                        Which is super intuitive, for example a div class="thing1 thing2" and with both .thing1 {edited} and .thing2 {edited} both css attributes can be applied in one line of class="". 
                        I love this part so much, and I can see how complex it can get from here. 
                        I havn't finished the project yet, as I got to step 47, but its good for showing me how things can be nested together and how different attributes work, making things bold, float, and use the overflow properties, which still are confusing but I'll get it soon enough. 
                        Now there is not much more I really want to say, I'm going to be quite busy with real life things on day 13, but I will still get my hour of code in to keep this challenge rolling!

                        Today was working with more CSS concepts and properties. 
                        A gripe I have with freeCodeCamp at this moment is their way of explaining things they want you to accomplish, such as "make this thing happen and have it have an [ID] of _____" then when I go and do that, and check my code it throws up a "nope, you were suppose to have a [Class=____]" and like... cmon. 
                        but other than that I was working on <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\Flex Box Photo Gallery\index.html" target="_blank">this project</a> which is a cat photo gallery made with the teachings of flex box. 
                        Now learning <em>some</em> flex box has actually filled in the part of my knowledge gap that I've had itching at the back of my mind wondering "well how do these things even stay in colums and be structured!". 
                        With this exposure I feel like I am the audiencemeber at a magicians show who knows how the trick is performed and all the secrets behind the showmanship. 
                        Even if I don't fully yet 100% understand every part, or even remember every part moving forward(that'll take some repetitive action) I really enjoyed knowing how these containers can be... <em>flexed</em>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don't have much more to go over. 
                        It's hard to be able to code for an hour or more everyday, as by the time I get to it i'm already so tired. 
                        Luckily I got out of work earlier than normal due to it being slow, and had some time to get some relaxing time in, which has been a well needed thing. 
                        Though on the other hand I honestly think as soon as I sit down at my desk when I get home I need to immediately work on it, if I don't it seems to becomes harder to do with every passing hour. 
                        I need to still be in that "work mode" mind set, as when I start relaxing it just puts me off my top game. 
                        I'm excited to get finished with the freeCodeCamp certificate, but nervous at the same time as to what I'll work on next. 
                        Perhaps once that day is apon me this webpage/site will get an overhaul, somewhat. 
                        I also need to think of some projects and in general things I could build moving forward. 
                        On top of that thought I also will be deep diving into JS at somepoint so that will be a whole other uphill convo to have when I arrive to that point in time.

                    <p class="post-title"><b>Day 010:</b> <u><em>August 10th 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                    <p>
                        So today started off with quite the funny situation. 
                        Within the first 5 minutes of working on fixing my <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects/Survey Form (Manditory Project)/index.html" target="_blank">Survey Form</a> project I fixed it and it passed... 
                        The issues I was facing were that the top three entry fields; name, email and age, didn't have an id="___" saying what the certification required. 
                        So after adding them, I realized that the two type="radio" buttons, both Yes and No, didn't have a value="" set to them, so if the form were to work it wouldnt put and data through, I'm guessing. 
                        Anyway, like I said it took 5 minutes and I passed. Now about that project on a more personal basis. 
                        I took quite a chunk of the styles.css code(not copy and paste) from Day 8's project: <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects/Registration Form/index.html" target="_blank">Registration Form</a>(as reference code). 
                        Essentially I wrote down the same code in a very similar order as I knew the code worked on the previous page and I honestly only grasped "some" of what it was affecting. 
                        The actual attributes made sense, some foggier than others, but I'm still rolling with training wheels on, so coming up with the way of rebuilding something I already built seemed like way more work than just playing around with what I had already written, tweaking things here and there to see how it changed the output of the page. 
                        That process took me down the path of getting the page to how I wanted and even researching outside methods I had yet to learn through freeCodeCamp to try more of the styling that I wanted to do. 
                        The page is not perfect, even a little. 
                        But with a standard 16/9 monitor the page looks fantastic, once you squeeze the pages sides the background breaks and that was my biggist hurdle I had to move on from and just "accept" as I am limited everyday by time. 
                        Overall I'm proud of the page I built, as I wasnt expecting to make it actually look good, I was worried it would look ugly, somewhat like this blog does right now, I know I can make it better. 
                        But it's only a matter of time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now since that required project only took up 5 gosh dang minutes to finish today, I got to work on the first mini project of the next batch of educational material from freeCodeCamp. 
                        This project was solely focused on teaching me the fundementals of how html elements are boxes with layers of adjustable variables that can be places next to eachother and promptly what I image as object kinetic programming. 
                        Now I could be using that term wrong, but in this case I am defining it as the use of these box models as objects that can interact with eachother from either inside or next to other objects on a webpage. 
                        This explanation makes it easier to think about the use and understanding of CSS on a simple level. 
                        Connecting the logic to that of real life, too much for me to explain fully in words here, but I'm sure you understand what I mean. 
                        Now in the <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\CSS Box Model\index.html">Box Model</a> project it focused on building a replica of a painting from scratch. 
                        Albeit a very simple painting but something made from code rather than pixel data, being an img. 
                        Introducing me to attributes like trasform: rotate(), filter: blur(), border-radius, and overflow, all while explainging the padding methods and margin methods of fitting objects into their parent div tag. 
                        I think overall the webpage is ugly yes, but useful in exposing me to new techniques and refreshing me with the same but more digestible ones. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (<em>Very</em> Personal Section)<br>
                        (Not sure why I needed to say these things, but man I was holding this in)<br>
                        I cannot express how much I want this career change. 
                        Working on this day to day makes me realize it more and more, and I truely feel this is the correct path for me. 
                        Now I don't know if being a web developer is my final "big plan", as I could fall into anything down the line and I'm open to it as long as it has something to do with coding. 
                        I'm having a more difficult time continuing my day job, and I wish I could do this already. 
                        I know I'm not there yet but man, every day really drills it in that I want much more out of life and doing what I'm doing daily is not it. If my current employer happens to read this(as I do show him my efforts in this space, and we are a tech company. we have discussed jr web dev position possibilities etc.) I do enjoy some aspects of what I do, I understand I wasn't hired for anything other than my current position, but for me that just isn't enough for me. 
                        Now I may never get what I am working for at my current job and thats how life goes, but I will get it somewhere at some point. Everyday that goes by I am working towards that. I can't keep cleaning and pulling items for orders, its soul sucking. And honestly I hold the belief that no money value(expect for stupid amounts) can tie me to a job that I don't want to do, so my $17/hr is not nearly enough. With how inflation is going especially where I live, a livable wage is requiring a full "career change". 
                        And I really don't want to continue struggling to pay my bills.
                        I hope this doesn't come off as ungreatful, or anything close to that. 
                        To me it somewhat feels like it does, I know the difficulties of life as of now, I've been through quite a bit and I really want to be successful in my passion. 
                        I'm learning that I am really determined any time I sit down at my desk to code and work on things. 
                        The hours fly by and I don't hate a second of it. 
                        This really has become a passion. 
                        And I mean, it was one back in 2019, had I stuck to it I would be somewhere totally different in my life. 
                        I was dealing with addiction problems back then and even up to earlier this year, relating to a certain legal substance here in my state. 
                        Addiciton can really be a hard thing to deal with when you don't even want it anymore but your body tells you otherwise. 
                        Where you get sick when you go without it, shivers, abdominal pain, and fevers. 
                        The anxiety from every second before I would use it, just to make the sick go away. 
                        And the pure panic when on it. 
                        All I can say now, is I'm out and my life is changing as quickly as I can make it. 
                        ALL for the better. 
                        Sorry this got heavy and seemingly unnecessary, peace and love.

                        I have run out of time to write a thorough post here for today, but I have started and almost fully completed the 5th Project! 
                        There are only some minor tweaks needing to be made to it for it to pass the "exam" on freeCodeCamp. 
                        You can find the entry made by me for this project <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects/Survey Form (Manditory Project)/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                        I think it is wonderful, not perfect by any means but it was my best shot for the two hours I put into it. 
                        Now I really must be hasty and get off the computer before my girlfriend... unalives me, so I bid thee fair well untill tomorrow where I'll complete the project and have a checkmark thingy to show off!

                    <p>
                        Hello! I worked through the 4th project on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp's</a> Responsive Web Design Course. 
                        And from this section I completed this <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects/Registration Form/index.html" target="_blank">Registration Form</a>. 
                        It took me over and hour and twenty minutes to complete and I ran into <em>some</em> issues during my learning. 
                        It seemed like mostly poor explaining on how many of what kind of things they wanted me to do be be correct, and some other instances it was just me missing a letter/misstype. 
                        Beyond that, the outcome of this effort was quite good, as I now have a great reference source of using html forms(which was my and is still my weak spot) to make a whole page to collect user input data. 
                        Now the real fun begins, well tomorrow and moving forward at least. 
                        The 5th part of this section is the required part for obtaining the Certification from freeCodeCamp. 
                        I'll be working on and making a Survey Form, and I will have a major cheat sheet if needed(the previous form I mentioned just a line or two ago). 
                        I took a peek at it when I completed the registration form and boy is it daunting. 
                        I feel tomorrow will be tough and time consuming, and I am definitely intimidated yet excited to work on it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        OH! and another thing I did recently, after posting Day 7's section, I turned the repository that this site is being saved and commited to into a GitHub Pages page! 
                        So now just about anyone can take a peek at it live and see where I'm at without looking at raw code, which is for the nutty folks out there, but none the less it's really cool they provide this service. 
                        I've used it before in the past, a good... omg, just about 4 years ago or so?! 
                        Way back when I was first getting into coding and when I was enrolled @Lambda School(in DataScienece)(@Bloom Institute, these days). 
                        But anyhow, I'm workin hard, not toooooo hard due to time constraints but I'm showing up everyday to bang out an hour or more, so YAY. 
                        Here's to our ever continuing uphill journey!

                    <p>
                        Firstly, HAPPY 1 WEEK OF CODE!!! I held myself to it, and accomplished this first goal of mine, we may <em>only</em> have 93 Days left to go through(realistically it's endless but lets not think about that right now) but this first week has been honestly a lot of fun.
                        I hit the ground much earlier today to finish up this project before I had to go out of the house and do lots of driving. 
                        Finished up the CSS Markers <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects/CSS Color Markers/index.html" target="_blank">page</a> and learned a few more concepts behind the previously mentioned functions, rgb(), hsl() and linear-gradient() and their extra syntax specifications. 
                        Like rgba() hsla() and hex colors being used in a box-shadow. 
                        Speaking of box-shadow, all of the attributes that I have come accross thus far that have these extra value placements in one line are super cool to me and I think they are going to be hard to keep track of!
                        The div displaying is still really new and a tiny bit hard to grasp but I think over time of using them more and more to design pages I'll get use to them. 
                        As well, in this project I needed to put divs next to each other and overall organizing the order of things is still confusing at this time. 
                        I just don't think I've had enough time working with them yet, but I cannot wait to be confident-ish in the use of them in the hopefully near future! 
                        The next project in front of me for the start of week 2(such a cool feeling to be this consistant) is going to be building a registration form, and honestly I really look forward to it. 
                        The whole time earlier in this challenge when I was first introduced to forms, I wondered, how could I really use them in more detail to make something useful. 
                        Now I don't think its going to be any fancy authentication or anything but still I wonder how it will be built to take input data and where it spits it out, to actually be used maybe? 
                        All I do know is I want to have more practice building things like that, and learning about how to securely and safely transfer user data and login information and such accross the web. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Can't wait to get started. 
                        Also I would like to shout out the amazing people and community on twitter who are all super into lifting eachother up and supporting one another. 
                        It's all so motivating to be a part of this challenge and group of like minded people.  
                        So I truely thank you for reading, and or just being you!

                        I ended up working on this hour of code late into the night as my day was full of other things being done and I was just so mentally exhausted that I pushed it back further and further, I wish I had gotten it done super early in the day as I would have been able to go longer and do more. 
                        Possibly leading to better retention of learned material, as I am EXTREMELY tired now... 
                        Anyway, what I got to work doing today was the third project linked <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects/CSS Color Markers/Aug6Post/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                        While unfinished it's teaching the building blocks of digital coloring and color theory of sorts. 
                        Like the rgb() function, hsl() function, along side the inear-gradient() function, working with 90deg, and color function values nested inside. I am looking forward to working more with it tomorrow to get this project finished without beind so tired. 
                        And I regret being in this unfavorable mental space for this day but none the less am excited to push on and get it going tomorrow!

                        Today was quite the day, I spent my time working with this website. 
                        Using my new fledgling skills with CSS to make a nice fancy stylesheet. currently the website looks like <a href="images/website_8-5-22.PNG" target="_blank">this</a>. 
                        I am currently very proud and I'm excited to explore what more I can do with CSS to make my site and future projects looks snazzy. 
                        I also updated the other pages on this site(as of current) to use the same stylesheet, making the blog site in total homogeneous is looks. Took me roughly a little over an hour to accomplish, with some extra work after a break inbetween, making it closer to 2hrs. 
                        Not much more to say for today, but tomorrow I expect to persue the next project on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a>. 
                        A difficult thing I'm noticing as of now is the hurdle of organizing my stylesheet and in general I feel somewhat comfortable with my html organization but I'm sure there are issues here as well. 
                        And on top of that I had a tad difficult time figuring out how to properly place all sections of the page to make it look right in its final form. 
                        For awhile I had a floating footer not at the bottom of the page, it was at the bottom of this Home page but on others it was seemingly in the middle having a swell time. 
                        I looked up a tutorial of sorts, simple code snippits conviently from freeCodeCamp's website and got it looking the way I wanted, for the most part. 
                    </p>

                        Last minute change before the day ends, I added a twitter hyperlink to the nav bar, check out my tweets throughout this journey or, at least in the future!
                        Anyway I look forward to <b>Day 6</b> See you then!

                    <p>
                        I finished the 2nd project on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a> and boy was it a doozie. 
                        Not difficult really, more like a lot of information and some repetitive actions. 
                        Which BTW I was liking, as to me the more you do it the more it will set in! I think? 
                        With the <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\CafeMenu\cafemenu.html" target="_blank">Cafe Menu</a> project complete I feel I have a fairly good understanding of CSS and the quickly intesification that happens with designing pages. 
                        I spent 1.283 hrs (1hr & 17minutes) working on this project, and it may seem like a long time to get that done but as you may have noticed if you've looked around in my github directory for this blog, I'm uploading the files along with completing the project on the websites code editor. 
                        No longer am I, currently, recreating the webpages by putting it side by side with a blank one. 
                        Instead I'm going the route of doing it two times, once on the website or personal editor first then immediately saving it and doing it on the other. 
                        Often times I'd complete it on freecodecamp then re-write the same code onto my own document. 
                        I was basically doing it two times, and I would even write it out on my own before entering it into the website. 
                        Confident enough to save my document before entering it in to see if it actually works, lol.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I can see myself getting into CSS and probably being the most overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of stylizations to be made, and having to get use to reading the scripts and properly understanding them at the same time. 
                        And I'm not sure how long it will take for me to look at a document of mine and just "know" what im looking at and what it refferences, I'd say this is my weak spot at this time. 
                        Something I want to get better at, and I want to build some really snazzy sites in the future. 
                        <em>I do have goals of turning this blog page into something way more... readable? and not so basic HTML ugly,</em> in due time but I wanted to throw this out there! For future me!
                        On a side-note I listen to a lot of podcasts on youtube while I'm at work, and they are all related to becoming a web dev, and boot camps and in general the experience people have at said boot camps. 
                        I feel myself falling into this world of different perspectives and options, not knowing if the path im choosing is the right one, or if I'm even capable of making it out to the other side. 
                        I sure hope I will, and feel if I'm not rushing anything I will make it there in due time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well anyway, today has been quite busy and not busy if that makes any sense. 
                        At work it was slow and I was trying to find things to do throughout the day, but right after getting home and taking a breather I hopped right into this project, and very much so enjoyed my time working on it. 
                        Thank you if you happen to be reading this, I know this is mostly for myself, helping to cement the concepts into my head but never the less I enjoy this current form of expression.

                    <p>
                        This day had me doing a few things, my first goal was to try and focus really hard on just getting a little more experience with forms. 
                        So with that goal in mind I made what is now in the top navigation bar, my <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">Contact Page.</a> 
                        Now it doesn't really send the data anywhere but that wasn't my first idea, or even how I wanted it to end up. 
                        At first I wanted to have it setup with a functional way to send the forms data to lets say an email, but as I am not hosting this on a web server and simply just on my pc, the source I was using wouldn't work. 
                        So I opted for the more simple approach for now where it just sends you to a basic landing page, go and give it a shot if you want. 
                        Anyhow after watching videos on this process and building out my form, I went around this site and adjusted some features that were inconsistant on some pages, as well as added new ones!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Which leads me right into what I worked on for the majority of my time spent today, which was around 1.5-2hrs. 
                        I went back onto <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a> and conitnued working on the <u><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">(New)Responsive Web Design</a></u> course. 
                        Started up the next project which was all about making a Cafe Menu page and styling it with CSS, you can check out my progress <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\CafeMenu\Aug3rdPost\cafemenu.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                        Its <b>SUPER</b> simple as of now but this is about as far as I could get with the time I had allocated today. 
                        And I was familiar with the vague layout/format of CSS, which comes from way back in 2018 when I was exploring web dev education for my first time. 
                        I use to watch a lot of a youtuber named Stefan Mischook on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/StefanMischook" target="_blank">YouTube page</a>, and actually bought a course from his website to learn how to code HTML, CSS and JS. 
                        I'll say that now reflecting on that is fuzzy but the underlying "brickwork" is there as my starting foundation and I feel this wont be as difficult as it could have been if I was still a complete novice. 
                        The linking process is probably the most important part of todays journey as that was the foggy mystery I needed to relearn as I had forgotten "how does a css page even connect to this html one?". 
                        Overall with this challenge and making these posts everyday, I feel good about what I have accomplished even if I wish it was more I doubt I would be able to retain it. 
                        I know I can build more and don't get me wrong it is quite... looming to think of all the information I need to get use to, but I'm here for it! Here's to the next 97 Days!

                    <p>
                        Today was quite the busy day, and to explain why will require some filler of my back story. 
                        So in my day to day life I work at a local ecommerce brick and mortor, that also does tech support for the area. 
                        I<em>(22)</em> live at home with my Brother<em>(soon to be 21)</em> and my Girlfriend<em>(20)</em>. 
                        My mother use to not so long ago live with us at our house, which is more of a townhome apartment building, but since recent has been staying in the same town she works in day to day. 
                        Every weekend, typically saturday, I drive down to where she stays and we go shopping for her grocries and spend some time together. 
                        And roughly once every 3 weeks I drive down to pick her up and bring her to our place for the week. 
                        Well that's what I did today, that driving part, so right after work I drove down(1.5hrs) to her and picked her up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My car, which is actually her car but is a longer story and honestly TL;DR, starts having some issues and we need to take a pitstop and let it sit for a brief amount of time. 
                        We head to our predestined location, a fast food joint! 
                        And we go in to grab a snack while we wait, I had already promised my Girlfriend that I would pick her up a lemonaide to bring back, my mom got some fries and a cookie to enjoy. 
                        Needless to say I left work at basically 4pm and arrived back home at 7pm. 
                        I start work everyday at 8:30am and really like to get plently of sleep so I had to quickly make dinner and get myself upstairs onto my computer to continue the <b><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfCode&src=typeahead_click" target="_blank">#100DaysOfCode</a></b> <b><a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/" target="_blank">Challenge!</a></b>
                        so I made this! This webpage is what I am using currently to <em>"blog"</em> about this coding challenge and where it takes me. 
                        So I've spent the past lil over an hour working on this, writing up everything I think I should put in it, and this is the result!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I will continue to work on this webpage after every session to fillout what I did that day, keeping a log of each step and difficult thing I came accross, and show that I can overcome them! 
                        It definitely helps that when I express dificulty with something during this challenge that I will have it logged and know what to focus more of my learning time on practicing. 
                        Thanks for reading!

                    <p class="post-title"><b>Day 001:</b> <u><em>August 1th 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                    <p>
                        I started on freecodecamp and entered into the <u><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">(New)Responsive Web Design Certification</a></u>. 
                        After completing the course in roughly an hour or longer, I cannot remember as I was "in the zone", I decided I wanted to continue practicing the new information that was fresh in my mind. 
                        I took the now finished page and loaded it onto half of my lefthand monitor, one of my two total monitors, and then put a fresh .html file next to it. 
                        I used the loaded premade page as reference and did my very best to replicate the work onto the new .html file without just completely copying the straight up code line by line. 
                        After I got down past the first list I got stuck with the figure tag and figcaption part of the page, more so I forgot how I implemented those images with added text underneath.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I then got to what for me was the most "forgotten" part of this first project. 
                        <a href="FreeCodeCamp_Projects\CatPhotoApp\CatPhotoApp.html" target="_blank">The Cat Form</a>, or in general, html forms with attributes, buttons, inputs, so many parts. 
                        I ended up peeking at the original reference page's html code to refresh my memory on what it was suppose to be. 
                        This then was leading me to remember enough parts to piece the rest of the buttons and labels together. 
                        I know looking back at it wonder in what way can I setup the part of this project myself that receives the submit field information, like where does it go? 
                        And how can I use it? 
                        Much to learn and lots to practice. 
                        I am grately looking forward to it!
