This "Blog" repository is a place for me to be able to play around and test out the things I'm learning and trying to reinforce in my education.
New files will be added or removed as I go through this learning process, and updates will be made to the main index.html as thats the blog page.

(9/10/22):
I've moved my Version 1 Blog page into a blog-v1.0 folder, for archival purposes.
And replaced it with a newer v2.0 blog page.
