This "Blog" repository is a place for me to be able to play around and test out the things I'm learning and trying to reinforce in my education.
New files will be added or removed as I go through this learning process, and updates will be made to the main index.html as thats currently my main blog page.

-- note --
I've added a "FreeCodeCamp_Projects" directory to hold the project I will be working on and each of their respective folders labeled accordingly. 
Including partial ones that I am at what ever time still working on which are located in each named project directory, labeld with the month, date, and use. Being either "Post" or ____ (something else in the future).

Images.html & Videos.html have no use ATM but I would like to do something with them eventually.

thankyou.html is a simple thank you page, noted in August 3rds Blog Post, respectively used when submitting a form on the contact.html page(which is currently not sending data anywhere, just redirecting to the thankyou.html).
